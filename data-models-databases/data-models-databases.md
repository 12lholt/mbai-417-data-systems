# Data Models & Databases

## Definitely Read This

[Homework Due 1/11 - 10PM Central](https://github.com/brook-miller/mbai-417-data/blob/main/data-models-databases/homework/Homework%20Assignment%201.ipynb)
* Save the homework to your google drive and then create a share link
* Submit url for the assignment via [canvas](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/160099/assignments/988109)
* Please include the names of your pair or triple in the submission

[Floating point info](https://github.com/brook-miller/mbai-417-data/blob/main/data-models-databases/homework/floating_point_oddities.ipynb) some info on floating point oddities and how to perform a cast in postgreSQL which will be helpful for the homework assignment

[Reflection Topic Assignments & Due Dates](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/160099/assignments) - I created groups and added a reflection assignment to each group in canvas with the appropriate due date.  Please reach out over email / class if you do not have a reflection assignment or if there seem to be problems.

## Probably Helpful
[Slides](https://github.com/brook-miller/mbai-417-data/blob/main/data-models-databases/data-models-databases.pdf)

[Instacart Demo Analysis](https://github.com/brook-miller/mbai-417-data/blob/main/data-models-databases/in-class/1-instacart.ipynb) - this is the analysis I reviewed in class. The code comments will show side by side markdown formatted if you open in colab

[Instacart Lab with Answers](https://github.com/brook-miller/mbai-417-data/blob/main/data-models-databases/in-class/lab_instacart_with_answers.ipynb) - I added some additional notes which should be helpful in understanding the queries

## Additional Readings & Links
* [Additional Instacart Analysis](https://github.com/brook-miller/mbai-417-data/blob/main/data-models-databases/in-class/2-instacart.ipynb) - If you haven't had enough SQL yet... We can calculate lift (search market basket analysis) right in SQL.  Bayesian likelihoods are used over and over with various names depending on the industry.
* [APIs Aren’t Just for Tech Companies](https://hbr.org/2021/04/apis-arent-just-for-tech-companies) - how to think about API first strategies as data products
* [The Case for ‘Developer Experience’](https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/) - the explosion of data and data products drives demand for more and more effective developers.
* [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) - CRUD apps are straightforward interface apps to a database.  While they seem "simple" there are often hidden "business logic" encoded in the interface and logic layer of the app.  We will talk about business logic in class 2.
* [REST](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/rest-apis)- Most of the APIs driving the modern web and mobile apps are a form of REST.  They typically transfer data using the http protocol encoded in the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format.
* [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) - this book is probably due for a second edition but is the definitive guide for understanding how applications are built and delivered at massive scale, early chapters are a good introduction to data models with a number of real life examples.  Maybe it's not the most recommended book on [hacker news](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&query=designing%20data%20intensive%20applications&sort=byDate&type=comment) but it is close.
