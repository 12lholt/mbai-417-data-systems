[Reflection Topic Assignments & Due Dates](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/160099/assignments) - everyone is assigned to a unique group and due date in canvas.  You will have both a reflection and a homework assignment in 1 week of class.

Homework and reflections are graded no-pass, pass, pass+.  These grades will be recorded in canvas as 0, 13, 15 for assignments and 0, 18, 20 for reflections.

My office hours will now be 4:30-6 on Wednesdays before class in L141
