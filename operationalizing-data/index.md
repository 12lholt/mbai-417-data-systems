[Reflection Topic Assignments & Due Dates](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/160099/assignments) - everyone is assigned to a unique group and due date in canvas.  You will have both a reflection and a homework assignment in 1 week of class.

Homework and reflections are graded no-pass, pass, pass+.  These grades will be recorded in canvas as 0, 13, 15 for assignments and 0, 18, 20 for reflections.

Office hours are by appointment only - please reach out via email if you'd like to connect.

[Reflections](https://github.com/brook-miller/mbai-417-data/tree/main/reflections) - As I complete grading I will post remaining reflections to this folder.
