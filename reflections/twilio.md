## Summarize the lecture / class discussion topics
How did Twilio start? What were their initial products?  

Twilio’s first product was Twilio Voice: an API product for making and receiving calls that took in phone numbers as parameters, and was completely cloud based. Twilio entered with a freemium product that had solid developer documentation.  

Twilio also launched in 2008 when the iPhone was first taking off and more people were interested in building apps for iPhones to enable communication.  

What are some of the keys to implementing an API-first strategy? Think about the 4P’s, how would Twilio segment/target the market for their products?  

An API-first strategy means that there is no physical product and there was no web-portal that you log into in order to use Twilio so there were low barriers to use it. Twilio’s API-first strategy allowed them to target app developers first to get them using the product rather than targeting business people.  

Twilio’s API documentation served as the primary marketing material for the product, and the Twilio APIs were built to accommodate an increasing variety of developer needs. The key is to target small-to-medium sized companies that would choose to buy rather than build a solution in house, and who have overstretched developers. Twilio made sure to develop APIs that could accommodate their initial target market and then expanded capabilities over time.   

4P’s:
* Price: Allow companies to get to market faster through a free tier / trial for developers
* Product: API-first strategy caters to developers and as they become evangelists for the product, Twilio organically brings in more customers. As Twilio grew, they made the product easier to implement, which allowed them to grow the scope of who can adopt it and grow their customer base. Twilio provides samples/pre-canned templates which make it even easier to adopt. 
* Place: Companies with systems to implement and corporations selling a product. Very broad customer base of developers who are seeking out new products that will make their lives easier (e.g. Twilio’s templates and developer documentation). 
* Promotion: Provide first months at no-cost with a usage limit to inspire adoption. Provide strong developer documentation, which serves as a form of organic marketing as developers spread the word at their employers.  

What are the key needs of a developer-first strategy? What challenges occur as a customer’s usage of Twilio grows?   

A developer-first strategy is when a product is built around developers, giving them easy access. Developers are able to self-service using Twilio’s documentation to easily start using the product. Having a developer-first strategy requires having strong developer documentation and community. As a result of a developer-first strategy, developers at potential customer companies become proponents of the software and can see the value in it as they use it.  

As developers grow to like the Twilio product, more stakeholders at these customer companies must be brought into the conversation to understand the value of Twilio’s product/service. As the relationship matures and more stakeholders are brought in, Twilio salespeople take over the general relationship to free up time for developers.   

One key challenge of a developer-first strategy is that it makes developers the end customer and initial point of contact at the customer company. Developers may not necessarily have decision-making power over their firm’s budget. In order for the finance team or senior leadership to approve the budget needed to pay for a service like Twilio, these stakeholders need to understand the value in Twilio. This means that after Twilio hooks the developers onto its products, it has to introduce non-technical marketing material so that the critical budget decision makers understand the value props of Twilio’s product.  

Additionally, as Twilio usage scales and the costs increase, it will necessitate a proper sales relationship to continue usage, as developers alone cannot maintain a significant number of client relationships nor were they intended to do so when initially hired. 

## Identify the key implications and takeaways
Twilio Start  
Twilio entered with a strong strategy, creating evangelists of developers and creating internal pressure at potential customer companies to purchase Twilio because of its high added value.  

API-First Strategy  

Firms using an API-first strategy constantly think about how their API will be used by potential customers and their developers. These strategies more quickly convert developers into evangelists as they use “purpose-built” products that make their job significantly easier.  

Developer-First Strategy  

People want to do things, but there aren't enough developers to get those things done, so no-code products and solutions like Twilio can change the world.
