## Class Discussion Topics

### Key Learnings for Product Managers
The discussion was centered around the concept that subject matter experts, users, and customers need to be involved during the entire development of the product. In order for the product to be successful at meeting the needs of the user, it is important that people who will be using the product are involved. This is especially important if the product is going to be developed for a very specific purpose and customer, and in this example for doctors to record and look for information for patients with cancer. Product managers will never be as experts in the medical field as doctors and thus in order to develop a product that is useful for doctors they need to involve doctors in the development process.

Additionally, we discussed that decision making can be a shared process and that it doesn't only rely on the product manager. 

### Use Cases for Flatiron Health's Data 

There are a number of reasons why Flatiron Health's data is valuable. At a macro level, the anonymized aggregation of cancer patient data allows for pharmaceutical companies and research institutes to have uniform data which can aid the development of new drugs or treatments. At an individual care level, the data is valuable because it can be easily searched by physicians and medical professionals, which can inform how they provide care for their direct patients. Because Flatiron Health's platform is developed with input from physicians and medical professionals, the use cases for the data are developed with the end user in mind to be able to provide the best functionality.

From an operations perspective, Flatiron Health's platform can help collect data around revenue cycles, billing, and other hospital administrative challenges, ultimately helping hospitals and care facilities to operate more efficiently and focus on providing the best patient care possible.


Key Implications and Takeaways

### Key Learnings for Product Managers
The main takewaway form our discussion on how subject matter experts need to be involved in the product development process is that this has allowed Flatiron health to develop products that are very useful for doctors. Additionally, it fosters creativity in developing those products and allows the company to solve problems more efficiently. This has also allowed Flatiron to be quicker at developing products as they do not have to go through many "useless" interations. In conclusion, while involving SME's in the development process might be expensive and time consuming, in the long run the company is saving time and resources.
### Role of AI at Flatiron

1. Flatiron uses ML and NLP to create richer datasets by improving the efficiency of extracting EHR data that is incomplete and difficult to access.
2. Flatiron employs ML to comb through millions of data points and reduce the time it takes for research teams to screen eligible patients for clinical trials. The faster patients get enrolled in trials, the faster they have access to innovative, life extending treatments.
