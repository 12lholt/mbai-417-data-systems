> It’s not about the data itself. It’s not just about the analytics—any
more than taking a vitamin is only so you can claim you successfully took a pill
every morning. When it comes to analytics, we have to keep in mind
the end goal is to help make better decisions more often. What we try to do
first and foremost is look at places where people are already making
decisions. We review the processes they use and try to identify either the gaps
in the available data or the amount of time and effort it takes to procure
data necessary to make an evaluation, insight, or decision. Sometimes we simply
start by attempting to remove the friction from the existing process.
