It will kill my dog eventually. She told me to stop feeding her the food because since I started using Cesar\u0027s three months prior, my dog was already overweight. She is just a little Pom. She also said to stay away from grain free because this is known to upset a dog\u0027s stomach and increase fat intake (it\u0027s bad pet food fad right now), and grain free does not provide any benefit to dogs. Dogs are not people after all. I was disappointed because this food is expensive. You think you are buying something healthy for your loved pet, but is is unhealthy junk. Feed at your pet\u0027s risk.  Or at least ask your veterinarian before hooking your dog on a dog\u0027s version of fast food.",

There are better foods to feed your dogs. This works for us because of similar priced brands this has better ingredients. It\u0027s affordable. And it\u0027s better for the cost. But when you compare to higher end products the ingredients just don\u0027t add up. It\u0027s a given that would occur. If youve got the money by all means buy a better product but for us this is the best i have found of what we can afford. As for flavor can we get a similar style for poultry without the add ins? Maybe i\u0027m missing it but i can\u0027t find any other flavor just meat. My dogs like the flavor, or possibly the texture, better than kibble. But i\u0027m certainly not trying it to find out. Please also consider more environmentally friendly packaging. I feel awful throwing away the amount of plastic and foil i do when i serve this. Like i said though its what i can afford and a better list of ingredients to that price range so i\u0027ll have to keep buying til something better comes up.",

Fortunately, I opened the front door only 35 minutes after the driver delivered the dogfood but the package was so hot to touch, that I had to leave it sit in our a/c home for a few hours before opening it. Even still, the bottom of the small package was still hot to touch!! Would recommend Amazon drivers leave items in a shady spot on people\u0027s porches.",

The vet said this sounded like a food intolerance, didn\u2019t believe him but I changed her food and YUP. She was fine for the week we gave her Rachel rays- then I bought this again just thinking it\u2019s her favorite and that night again after only a day of eating it she went right back to doing this.",

    "body": "SUDDENLY MY SICK, ELDERLY CHIHUAHUA CAN EAT AGAIN AND KEEP HIS FOOD DOWN!!! YAY!!! MY LITTLE DOG IS EATING AGAIN AND KEEPING HIS FOOD DOWN!!! I am so thrilled!!! Because of a few negative reviews, I had avoided Cesar\u0027s Classics \u0026 other Cesar\u0027s products.  BIG MISTAKE.. at least on my part.  Our little 16 year old Chihuahua has developed a heart murmur and kidney disease.  Per our veterinarian\u0027s advise, our \u0022boy\u0022 was put on a special, prescription diet.  Unfortunately, he couldn\u0027t keep the prescription food down. I started him off slowly, mixing it bit by bit with his regular kibble.. which I regularly softened with bottled water.  It was okay the first day... but after that, he began throwing it up, having diarrhea, and then finally, just sniffing his food, and walking away.. NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED TO GIVE HIM when regular dog food wouldn\u0027t work... even eggs, eggs \u0026 bread, low sodium chicken broth on any kibble or eggs.. etc.. he wouldn\u0027t touch it... still,  he continued throwing up... even when there was only mucus left in his stomach!!! It was so sad to watch his condition worsened. Our poor little old Chihuahua was becoming just skin and bones. I expected to lose him any moment.  My worried, frustrated daughter offered to give him a tray of the Cesar\u0027s Classics, which she had occasionally been giving to her Chihuahua as treats.  I was at my wits end, so in spite of the few, isolated, negative reviews I had read, I gave her the okay.  Suddenly.. just smelling the peeled open food,  my sick, skin \u0026 bones little guy \u0022came alive\u0022 wiggling all over \u0026 wagging his tail! He reached for the tray before it was set down!!! Of course, I could barely recognize this strange but oddly familiar creature!!  As of now, about 6 days later,  he\u0027s been consuming Cesar\u0027s Classics, any flavor, at a healing and nurturing rate of 3 to 4 tray\u0027s per day!! NO THROWING UP.. NO DIARRHEA!!! I\u0027m happy to report that he\u0027s gradually putting on weight. Our veterinarian had explained that our Chihuahua\u0027s kidneys are \u0022eating\u0022 his body fat... that\u0027s why we had made the diet change which ended up making him so much sicker.  I\u0027m not saying that Cesar\u0027s Classics cures kidney problems. This moist pate\u0027 is however, providing much needed hydration, and our dear old dog eats happily, gets sated, and displays NO negative symptoms whatsoever, from consuming Cesar\u0027s Classics.  It\u0027s a pet\u0027s mealtime miracle, and thankfully, is a true blessing for this little guy!!! Yes, this investment is a real hit on my grocery budget. Is it worth it? You Bet!!! The resulting Peace of mind is Priceless!!! THANKS, CESAR\u0027S!!!!",

Eventually he stopped eating the dry food even with this, which indicated to me that he was sick of it... I did like that it came in a plastic cup rather than a can; I have had too many issues with dented and poor quality canned dog food. Of course, this leads to another issue which I guess this company had, which was having to recall some of their products because of plastic shards being in the food (pretty much stopped using once I heard those reports).I have since found a better dry food which he seems to eat no problem, and does not require wet food of any sort.",

Then came an awful smell in my kitchen and we couldn\u0027t figure it out.  The next day I went to get the dog food out and a container had alittle bit of food on the outside. When I went to open it up. It had the worst smell you can imagine. It was all discolored and spoiled. Smelled awful. Threw it away immediately and took the bag outside. I checked all the rest and they all seemed sealed. A little leary when I open the little containers. It was too gross and smelly for me to get a picture of it.",

Now he gets a mixture, but vastly prefers the Cesar\u0027s. I always vowed I would never feed my dogs wet food, because  handling it made me gag, but here we are. One improvement I think should be made is a reusable lid for the container. He never eats an entire portion so I have to transfer the rest to a lidded container. I have tried another brand of wet food that has a lidded container and he likes that too, but it is considerably more expensive. Buying the multi-pack of Cesar\u0027s saves a fair amount of money over buying the individual servings at the grocery store.",

This combination fills them up as best as a dog can be, and their veterinarian agrees that over the past 2 years that our pups have been consuming this diet that their health--and especially their weight--is right on track. The dogs also do not complain or deter from eating, probably because of the variety. Each night our younger dog gives the meal a critique, from one to four barks. So far the filet is her favorite.",

So what I do is I mix just a bit of Cesar with warm water, a sliver of the Cesar wet food, mix it up real good in the water then add his Science Diet dry food to the mix. Most of the time he eats the whole thing. Once in a while I\u2019ll find the pill in the bottom of the bowl. When that happens I\u2019ll put it in a bit of Cesar made into a ball and leave it on the bottom of the bowl.  I\u2019ve tried it with other brands of wet food but he won\u2019t eat it. So if you have the pickiest dog you might want to treat him to Cesar.",

The same happened to my brother\u0027s dog when he ordered another type brand food for his dog from amazon. I believe the issue to be the use of poor storing facilities!

    "body": "Our extremely fussy dog loves this food and never gets tired of it Trixie, our two-year-old Brussels Griffon, is an extremely picky eater. Forget kibble or any other dry food, even the ultra premium stuff. And she isn\u0027t crazy about medium-priced wet food either. When finally in desperation I fed her some Cesar\u0027s Gourmet Wet Food she gobbled it down in a flash.That was a year ago, and she still loves the stuff. We\u0027ve tried various varieties from their huge selection, and found out she does not like their stew-type varieties, with meat and other solids floating around in a sauce. Instead, she insists on Cesar\u0027s \u0022loaf\u0022 style offerings, her favorites being Fillet Mignon and Porterhouse Steak.We feed Trixie one container of Cesar\u0027s for breakfast and one for dinner, and with a couple of small treats over the day, she is perfectly happy. Her weight is holding stead at a good, trim level for the breed, and she has no bowel problems with this food. Her stool is nice and firm.At about $1 each,  feeding our 5 lb. dog comes to around $60 per month. Not chickenfeed. But this food is so conveniently packaged, and its ingredients are of such obviously high quality, and our beloved dog is so fond of it, we consider Cesar\u0027s to be an excellent investment. We buy it two months at a time in their multi-package offerings.",

I tried Bella food from a friend and it is a huge hit. I split one container in half for both of my dogs on top of their dry food and they clean their bowls every day, which is not a common thing in this house! Usually they would just let the food sit and not eat it. Or they would eat it then get sick (throw up/get diarrhea). Thankfully, no issues with this food! One of my dogs is a Shih-tzu, the other a small (same size as the Shih Tzu) mixed breed dog. They are 2 \u0026 10 years old. It\u0027s so nice to get something that works for both of them!",

Both have been on Cesar wet food their entire lives. The Yorkie is my picky eater but my Shih Tzu with literally eat any food that hits the floor. Potato skins, cucumber skin, literally anything! I had always bought their food from the store but decided to try Amazon as it would save me a few dollars. My Yorkie was refusing to eat, which isn\u0027t uncommon for her, so I mixed in boiled chicken. She has had diarrhea since and will not touch the Cesar wet food. My Shih Tzu flat out refused it even with chicken mixed in. I thought maybe they both had upset tummies. Feed them both chicken till tummies cleared up. Both are still refusing to eat the Cesar wet food that was bought through Amazon. I got a few packs from local store and they ate with no issues. I am wondering if the food maybe sitting in a hot environment for too long? Or something is happening in the shipping process? I have read others reviews on here saying they had same problem as me. I\u0027m going to contact Amazon or Cesar regarding this as I have 2 more 12 packs that I am uncomfortable feeding them. I will update my comment after I speak with them.",

I always give her quality food however within the last month or so for some reason she slowly stopped easting for a couple days I was so worried especially since she is so small. I knew that with her being so small this couldn\u0027t go on for long. A friend recommended Cesar which she feeds as a mixture with her bichon\u0027s food. I quickly ran to the store and got some of these.I was so happy to see that my Kylee started eating again.She licks that bowl clean!
