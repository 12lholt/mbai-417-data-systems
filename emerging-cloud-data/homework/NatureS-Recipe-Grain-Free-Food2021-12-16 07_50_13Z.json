At first I was pleased with this brand. She is willing to eat it, her poop didn\u0027t change, her hyperactivity didn\u0027t increase, and it\u0027s reasonably priced. HOWEVER, she began eating garbage, the grosser, the better, and trying to eat grass. This new behavior has grown into a seriously disgusting problem. I had already decided to switch brands when the last order arrived so I began feeding it to her while deciding which brand to go/return to. About 5 meals into the bag, the scoop hit a hard solid block. It\u0027s a stuck together clump of food measuring about 10\u0022x6.5\u0022x2\u0022 (pictured).I definitely won\u0027t be buying this again.",

One of my dogs was having allergy issues and constantly chewing on her paws, so the vet recommended trying a grain free food with no artificial junk like coloring ( let\u2019s be real here... dogs don\u2019t see color the way we do and don\u2019t care about the color of the food...lol!), artificial flavor, or preservatives. Where I live quality food is hard to find and very expensive as well, so the dogs had been getting whatever I could come across... some foods they liked and some they didn\u2019t, and I also had the challenge of having to get separate food for the puppy. He always wanted the adult dog food and the adult dogs always wanted his. Our problems are solved with this dog food because all of the dogs absolutely love it, the allergy issues stopped, and I get the Salmon, pumpkin, and sweet potato variety which is for dogs of all life stages.  A couple more things I like about this food is that their stools are a lot firmer so there is no more mushy poop to clean up, they have less smelly gas, the price is as good if not better than buying it at a brick and mortar store, and now my dogs associate the delivery guy with yummy food and greet him nicely at the door rather than trying to kill him...lol!",

My Beagle/mix was having severe problems wth yeast infection He smelled awful, and scratched all the time. Even though he was taking Vet prescribed flea/tick medicine - his scratching was continuous. I took him back to the Vet for the stinky, itchy problem, because I thought he had mange He diagnosed him as having yeast. Well, I gave him the itch medicine, along with the antibiotic for about 2 weeks. He did stop stinking and itching, but I knew it wouldn\u0027t last long. The antibiotics help, but it doesn\u0027t get to the root of tbe problem. I had been doing research and found that he had a \u0022gut\u0022 issue. I found out that his diet was the reason the yeast kept coming back.  I had to get rid of all the fillers, such as potatoes, corn, gluten, wheat, grains, soy, and fillers. I found this dog food, and decided to give it a try. He loves the taste, and he is no longer itching and scratching. I\u0027m so glad to have found this product.  This, along with medicated shampoo and raw treats has practically alleviated all his symptoms. Now, he won\u0027t have to stay on antibiotics - which were killing his gut flora. I will be buying more.",

My only family since my children passed.My senior long hair chihuahuas were eating this last year and seemed fine, until they weren\u0027t. I feed the chicken formula to both of them. About 6 months ago my littlest (4 lbs) was sick, really sick. She smelled strange and when I took a closer look she had black skin under her tan coat.She also had pustules that had become infected. Of course I went straight to the vet.The veterinarian prescribed something for her vomiting, an oral antibiotic for her sores and an anti-fungal shampoo for the dark skin. It\u0027s a fungal infection!!!She needs to be washed in the shampoo, stand for 10 minutes while it works, every other day. Needless to say she isn\u0027t a happy pup.She has never had something like this before! Ever!I\u0027m trying to research a dry food, small bite sized, senior beneficial ingredients. It isn\u0027t easy for less than around $6/lb. Which I\u0027m willing to do although I live on a fixed income.  Knowing which to choose that won\u0027t give her brother the p**ps and which won\u0027t get her sick again is a hit or miss now.

That is until the last two bags. The first bag I thought was some sort of fluke or mistake and the wrong kibble was in the wrong packaging, but it\u0027s happened again so I guess they\u0027ve changed the recipe. This kibble used to smell heavily of salmon and gave my dog major fish breath after meals. The last two bags I\u0027ve received have smelled like... I\u0027m not sure, burned vegetables maybe? Either way, not like fish and not appetizing. Since then her stool has been not so perfect and she\u0027s developed skin problems again. My mom\u0027s dog who also eats the same kibble has simply not been interested in eating it. This is a real shame since we used to love this, but I guess we\u0027ll be switching on the next bag.",

On the topic of freshness I always notice a difference in how it looks from the month or so old stuff at the end of a bag. So that\u0027s  good right? I honestly didn\u0027t want to taste this stuff. But, Otis seems to like it. Sometimes he even tries to trick my wife or me into feeding him after the other one of us has already given him his meal. I honestly wouldn\u0027t be that interested in having seconds, if I ate the same thing for breakfast and dinner every day of my life. So that being said, this must be the best tasting dog food there is. Seriously, though I\u0027m not gonna try it myself.",

Like many dogs, she likes new food better than food she is used to since it\u0027s a novelty; but she was especially excited about this, even given that. I had never tried this brand before, and had considered it a very average food; but now that I see how much she likes it I may rotate this brand in with her normal food rotation now and then since the ingredients are acceptable, even though it\u0027s not as \u0022fancy\u0022 as what she usually gets.

The fact that this food is grain free makes this a high fat and low fiber diet for my large american bulldog mix which led to him being very ill and needing to immediately go on a prescription diet at 5 years old.

    "body": "My dog wouldn\u0027t eat it! I have a dog that eats just about everything, due to some time spent on the streets before Rescue picked him up.  He likes bananas, Rice a Roni, canned peas, and nearly every dog food we put in front of him.  This bag was small, so we took it with us on a road trip a couple of hundred miles away to see Grandma.He wouldn\u0027t eat it.  He would pick up a mouthful of the food and spit it on the floor, over and over, until I stopped him.  I managed to get some other dog food, and put it in front of him -- voila he loved it!  So, the next day, I mixed the new dog food with this Lamb dog food.  Little dog outsmarted me:  he ate the second dog food, and spit out the Nature\u0027s Recipe!I am not a complete fool, so I dropped off the remainder of the food at the shelter (they know me, otherwise they don\u0027t take open bags). So I had to give the flavor of the food a one. (It gets a one from the dog.  I am not going to taste it myself to see if the flavor is yummy!)If you can\u0027t get a dog to eat it, it could be the healthiest dog food on Earth, and it wouldn\u0027t do any good.  I suggest you try the smallest container of it that you can find and see if your dog is as finicky as mine.",

However, the last bag I ordered from Amazon arrived 6/8/2020, after her first meal from the new bag she had terrible diarrhea and had to go outside 4 - 5 times through the night. Since we\u0027re out on 40 acres in SD and take daily walks I thought perhaps she\u0027d gotten into an old, left behind (by coyotes or whatever) deer leg or eaten some deer or whatever\u0027s poop which can sometimes happen and throw their stomach off. So I fed her another breakfast and supper of this food and my poor girl had awful diarrhea again all through the night. Next few days I cooked some boiled hamburger and rice for her and the problem was solved. So it\u0027s most definitely the bag of dog food.  That\u0027s the last time I\u0027ll ever feed her that brand.",

    "body": "This stuff is dangerous!! My dog got violently ill on this food. I thought for a while he was just being fussy when he didn\u2019t want to eat it. I would wait when he got hungry enough to eat he would scarf it down. Turns out he was trying to tell me something. His liver became inflamed, so inflamed in fact that he began vomiting violently for two days and diarrhea, at one point he was bleeding from his rectum. I rushed him to the nearest animal hospital and paid $1000 to have an ultrasound and bloodwork done STAT in the animal hospital ER only to find out that while his health had been just fine, his liver was severely inflammed and he was dehydrated to the point of critical condition. The first thing they asked me was what are you feeding him? I was told that if he survives at all I am to IMMEDIATELY stop feeding him this food. I will now need to seek alternative (and expensive) food that will be gentle on his compromised liver for the rest of his life and will possibly need a prescription to help his liver heal and function as well as can be. OUTRAGEOUS that this food was originally recommended to me by a trusted pet supply store and still being sold everywhere!!! Please read labels and protect your pet. Don\u2019t do what I did. Watch your pets and listen to them when they try to tell you they don\u2019t want to eat their food, it\u2019s for a reason!!",
