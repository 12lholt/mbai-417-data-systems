Dogs poop double the amount now.  The last few months we have seen a drastic change in each bag.  The color from bag to bag has changed and varies greatly.  The smell of the food is getting worse, I can\u0027t stand to open the closet it is stored in and it is inside of a container in that closet.  My dog doesn\u0027t want to eat it. My dog started having skin tags and fatty lumps.  They do come with age, but I consulted my vet.  My vet said Blue Buffalo is not good quality and she does not recommend their food.  She said multiple studies have shown the food does not use the quality ingredients like the ads claim and they do use crappy fillers.  I switched to science diet and now his skin and fat lumps are improving.  He really likes the new food.  Before he would refuse to eat for days other than a little here and there.  Now he is happy to be fed.  Will no longer buy Blue Buffalo products.",

I thought maybe the bag of BB cat food went bad b/c of the heat, so I bought another bag. The cats started throwing up again. I stopped feeding them Blue Buffalo and they haven\u0027t had any issues since.

Guess I\u0027ll be doing my dog food shopping elsewhere. Haven\u0027t contacted Amazon about it yet, but I have a idea of how it\u0027s going to go. I don\u0027t want to go through all the trouble of sending it back and waiting a few more days to get another one.EDIT: I contacted Amazon, and the robot surprisingly helped me better than I expected.

By the time I had switched her over she was having diarrhea (having to go out ever 2 hours or less if she was whining at the door), and throwing up on my bedroom carpet.

I have heard of some dog foods making dogs sick, but never had the experience before.  Not this one.  I have two dogs and one is very picky, so I was looking for a good brand that they would like to eat.  I gave Blue Buffalo chicken first.  They ate, but one of them started refusing it, so I decided to switch to grain-free salmon.  Within a week they got horrible horrible diarrhea.  One couldn\u0027t stop himself and in the end it became all brown water at every 45 minutes.  I took both to a vet and they got medication, ate rice and chicken for several days and I thought it finally cured them.  I did not suspect it was food, so started mixing small amount again.  Then they\u0027re back to the horrible diarrhea again.  I had both dogs for many years (one is 17, the other 8) and they never had any issue with dog food.  This is a horrible, horrible product.  If I could, I would like them to reimburse all medical cost and their sufferings.  Stay away by all means,  do not believe the high rating.  This is seriously dangerous.",

    "body": "Do not feed this to your dog as the only food he eats Our Siberian husky had digestive problems most of his life and it kept getting worse along with his health. This seemed to be the only food he would eat. Constant diarrhea. He started limping and we thought it was getting close to the time to put him down. Hair started falling out on his tail. That was a few years ago. Now my dog runs, plays, has normal  movements and could not be happier. What did we do? We now cook all his food, He eats the dog healthy parts of human food, boiled chicken, turkey, rice, tuna, salmon, other meats, table scraps, green beans, sweet potatoes, and other veggies. All of this is simply garnished with Blue Buffalo, but that is the last thing left in the bowl. When he is still hungry, he eats the Blue. Take this for what it is worth. He also gets quite a few supplements and has been placed on thyroid medicine. Also avoid too many dog treats.",

    "body": "Caused dietary issues for my pup Decided to try slowly integrating this food into our dog\u0027s regular food (Hills Science Diet) since she was having some early morning urgency to go outside and eat grass.... for 15-20 minutes. It was only ever in the morning and would sometimes happen 2-3x before she\u0027d feel better and eat her breakfast (she\u0027s a beagle so normally she scarfs down any meal ASAP). Googled it, and thought maybe she wasn\u0027t getting enough nutrients in her diet. So we slowly started incorporating blue buffalo into her meals. Almost immediately we noticed she was gassy, with foul smelling farts. Her tummy would gurgle, and she wasn\u0027t as interested in her meals. We gave it a few days before I called our vet for advice. She said, and I quote: \u00229 times out of 10 when I see a dog coming in with some digestive issues, they\u0027re being fed Blue Buffalo.\u0022 She advised we go with a dog food brand that is larger and more well-known, such as Hills or even Purina, she said, because those companies do more testing and quality control than the smaller companies like Blue Buffalo. I was surprised by this, since I\u0027ve heard Purina food is trash, and I thought Blue Buffalo was well known and a big brand like Hills or the like, but I guess not! Anyway, long story short, once we stopped using even a little of Blue Buffalo she stopped eating grass (even though this behavior had started before we incorporated BB) and has been fine ever since. yay!",

It has been the best for our girl.She eats it like there\u0027s no tomorrow and is now down to an weight that the vet is happy with.

I got a second dog, a pit a year ago and switched to the adult food. They transitioned fine a year ago. However, over the past month or two, they have been throwing up and having diarrhea. I thought maybe it was allergies, but after feeding my dogs plain cooked chicken because they wouldn\u2019t eat their food, their stool and energy level changed dramatically. I am throwing the rest of the dog food out which I just opened a couple days ago. If you care about your dog or dogs, don\u2019t feed them this brand.

Her breed requires higher amounts of protein than others which could be the reason for such dramatic results but either way it tells me the food is garbage. A dog will generally poop once after every feeding if receiving the correct amount of food for their breed, size, and activity level. Other things to look for are color, hardness, and size of the stool of course. I\u2019ve noticed the higher the protein content the darker the stool. The bottom line is if a pet food brand HONESTLY cares about the quality of pet food they make the same standards of quality will be reflected in everything they produce. Very disappointed.",

She ate those few pieces, walked away and to this date not returned. However we have fed her other brands and that was consumed. CONCLUSION: SHE DOES NOT LIKE YOUR PRODUCT.I am reluctant to throw the bag out to the squirrels. Can I get a refund, because this ain\u0027t no cheap stuff!!!",
