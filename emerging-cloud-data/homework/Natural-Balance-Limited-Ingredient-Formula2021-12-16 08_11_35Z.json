She started throwing up regularly and we couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. We have family with a dog who is on the exact same dog food, and has been on it for a long time. She has been incredibly sick with diarrhea since the change in formulation. Many expensive trips to the vet, antibiotics, and nothing seemed to help. At Christmas with all the dogs together we put two and two together... the food is making them both sick! Since changing their food, they have no longer been getting sick. The manufacturer should have to disclose of changes made to a product.",

I adopted her in August of this year and she was noticeably dull with some bare patches in her fur. I had initially tried to start her on a different brand of food but it didn\u2019t seem to digest well for her. My mom uses natural balance for her cats and they are extremely healthy with beautiful plush coats. I figured I\u2019d give the dog food a try and noticed an immediate difference. She has no problem digesting the food and she is so soft and shiny compared to how she was when we adopted her. I\u2019ve included a before photo and 2 after photos showing the difference in her appearance.",

    "body": "Excellent choice for dogs with allergies About a year ago I had switched my dog to the Acana Wild Atlantic dog food since my dog loves fish and I had heard great reviews of it.. After a few months on the food my dog developed a cough/choking disorder and also developed a filmy yellowish later inside her ears (she has never had any ear mites nor fleas or any ear disorder). Since the vet was closed other than emergencies for coronavirus I had to wait for an appointment since she didn\u2019t appear to be in distress). I was shocked when the vet told me the cough/choke and ear condition was due to food allergies. The vet said older dogs normally do not develop food allergies and asked if I had switched her diet recently. (The diagnosis was after a thorough exam of labs/cultures and xrays).. I was shocked to discover that she had food allergies since I had changed brands of dog food almost annually throughout her life without a problem (she likes variety ha). In any event, my vet suggested a lamb and rice formula would be best for her and suggested a few brands to try. In less than a week on this food my dogs symptoms vanished. The price is also significantly less than Acana (almost 4x lower). I highly suggest this dog food!",

Recently adopted a second dog who was unhealthy- and her skin flaky and coat full. One week on this food and she had a beautiful coat to match our first dog. They both love this food!

I opened a brand new bag a little while ago and thought things were fine. I came to find out my dog had started throwing up in one of the hidden corners of the house, leading to a pretty major mess for me to clean up. I\u0027m not sure how long he was doing it, but I tried decreasing the amount of food I gave him, eliminating treats, etc.  Then I noticed that on one of my old empty bags of this stuff it said they were updating the formula soon. I can\u0027t believe it took me this long to put 2 and 2 together, but I\u0027ve ordered him another type of food and am giving him a bland diet til it gets here. He just came inside from going potty and very clearly had diarrhea. I feel awful that he\u0027s gone through these last couple of weeks with such horrible stomach problems and me being clueless and just finding alternate ways to feed this food to him. (like half his usual amount in the morning, half in the afternoon, etc.) I thought he was also just losing a little weight because he was getting older, but it\u0027s clearly because of this stuff. For shame, changing the formula and putting dogs at risk, especially mine that\u0027s a senior and needs all the balance and health in his life that he can get.",

    "body": "DO NOT BUY THIS FOOD Normally, I don\u2019t usually care enough about a product to write a review (negative or positive) but I did feel the need to share our experience with this dog food. We have been feeding both of our dogs this food for years with no issues. Recently, Natural Balance changed their formula to add more protein. Now, this didn\u2019t really raise a red flag for us because we figured this wouldn\u2019t affect our dogs. When we bought our most recent bag of this food (May 2020) and opened it to fill our dogs\u2019 food container, we noticed a very pungent smell coming from the food. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a BAD smell, just a lot stronger than normal. Within a few feedings, one of our dogs (small breed) went from missing the occasional meal to outright refusing to eat it at all and only eating to prevent herself from starving. She would eat treats and table scraps, which told us that her appetite wasn\u2019t the problem. Same dog started vomiting more often: typically after having missed a feeding or two or she would eat large amounts of grass to soothe her poor tummy and induce vomiting. At this point, we didn\u2019t conclude it had anything to do with the food because our other dog (large breed) was eating and behaving normally. We consulted our vet at their yearly appointment and she didn\u2019t seem to think much of this new behavior but advised us to give her bland food as needed. When we started to run low on this food, we made the decision to switch to a completely different brand. Since switching, our dog has stopped vomiting, missing meals, and seems a lot more energized and happier and it\u2019s only been a few days.In conclusion, if you\u2019re thinking of switching your dog food to this brand or continuing to feed them this particular food, beware! We looked up the formula change to see if anyone else had the same experience and many other dog parents were reporting similar behaviors. As of now, there aren\u2019t any recalls out there that we know of but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they issue one soon.",

    "body": "Beware: New Formula, My Dog Hates it! The new formula of Lamb and Rice LID is terrible. My dog with food allergies has eaten this brand and this flavor for over 7 years without issue, until the new and improved formula hit the shelves in the last month or so. She refuses to eat it or when she\u2019s finally hungry enough to give in and eat it, she has had tummy problems. After a few weeks, I took  her to the vet because of weight loss and digestive (poop) issues thinking she was sick. The good news, nothing is wrong with my dog; the vet asked about her food and she knew right away the problem was not my dog but the new formula as the vet has had several other owners with the same problems. Whatever Natural Balance did to the formula did not improve anything, except perhaps their pocketbooks! Very disappointed with the purchase and so sad for my dog who now has to adjust to a new food. Food consistency is so vital for a dog\u2019s health, consult any veterinarian (I assume Natural Balance didn\u2019t). So now I have to experiment with new brands and foods to find the right fit for my beloved dog. And when I say new food, I mean a different brand entirely, I won\u2019t be buying Natural Balance food anymore and will move on to a competitor\u2019s line.",

We do not feed them any food aside from their dog food. It also seems like there is an extreme increase in crumbs/powder in the bag. It seems as if the food was of lesser quality and we tried to see if it was just the one bag but was 2 or 3 months of them having regular issues.",

Still had allergy issues but not as bad as in others (she\u2019s supposed to be on prescription food but I can\u2019t afford it). I thought we\u2019d switch flavors to see if she did any better on the lamb. About two weeks in both my dogs began to vomit. I immediately switched back to the duck flavor and no problems since. Something about the lamb caused major stomach issues.",

    "body": "Switched from Blue Buffalo I finally switched my 30lb german shepherd mix over to this food last month. Since she was a puppy I have been giving her the blue buffalo wilderness (chicken and lifesource bits). But she has always taken mouthfulls of the food, spit it out, and eaten only the brown pieces and left the little black ones. I was also wary after reading about grain free foods and the health issues it can cause. So because of all of that, I decided to switch her over. She seems to like it a lot more, and I\u0027ve noticed she has been eating more since I switched her. She free feeds, and never eats everything I put in front of her. She is a lean dog - not overly skinny, but definitely could use a few extra pounds. The switch was seamless and she didn\u0027t have any digestive issues. I know you\u0027re supposed to mix the new with the old when you are transitioning, but I didn\u0027t do that and she was fine. I will be sticking to this food from now on. It\u0027s convenient to have it on auto-delivery.",
