He gets a bad rash that usually turns into a skin infection (so irritating to him; so lots of licking and things go down hill from there). We had to put him on monthly allergy shots in addition to his flea protection \u2014but the skin irritation continued.  I researched dog foods available for various conditions and found the Hill\u2019s Science Diet for sensitive stomach and skin. He is a pretty picky eater, so half the battle is getting him to eat any food we give him. From the start, he loved the food.  After feeding him this food for a week or so, his condition started to improve.  Within a few weeks, we were able to discontinue the allergy injections. He will occasionally have a small flare up and can now treat it successfully with a topical medication from his veterinarian.",

    "body": "It gave my five years old beagle huge seizures I thought this could never happen with such an expensive and reputable brand of dog food like Hill\u2019s Science, even recommended by veterinarians, causing my dog to get near death huge seizures. Seizures did not start after several weeks until my dog had gone through about half the 24-pound bag of Hill\u2019s Science dog food, when I noticed every time he finished eating his bowl of food, he would go to sleep for a while only to wake up drooling. He would then beg me to let him go out to the backyard. Once in the yard, he started wondering around walking slowly, eating grass and getting more confused and drooling more and more. Then the big seizure came next, his entire body would start shaking, his eyes would turn watery and brick red colored, and then his four legs would lock and get completely stretched out to the point that he could still be stood up but painfully take short steps with his four legs locked straight and with his back curved into an arch. It was like he had received a high voltage shock. Each of the frightening seizure episodes lasted for about twenty to thirty minutes and then it slowly stopped. After seeing him in two occasions vomit his entire full bowl of undigested pellets, I slowly put the pieces together that the cause of his seizures could be Hill\u2019s food because I did not feed him any treats of any other kind of food. I got rid of half the bag of Hill\u2019s Science and switched him to Chicken Soup for the Soul. He was fine for a week or so but still I had to feed him a lot less and he started to lose too much weight so I decided to give it a try to Blue Buffalo Freedom Grain Free Natural Adult Dry Dog Food. These pellets are half the size of Hill\u2019s Science. They are triangular shaped intermixed with small size bb shaped pellets even smaller than those of Chicken Soup for the Soul.Three weeks went by without any seizures. So I hope it stays that way. After our frightening ordeal was over, out of curiosity, it occurred to me to run a simple experiment with a few pellets I kept from his Hill\u2019s Science food. First, I tried unsuccessfully smashing one pellet with my fingers with no success. Then I dropped a few pellets in a small bowl of water and after 15 minutes had passed, I pressed them as hard as I could with my thumb to see if I was able to smash them into a soft mass but I could not because the center was too compact and hard as plastic; much less seeing them dissolve in the water on their own. How could a poor dog digest such large and hard pellets? What kind of glue was in the pellets\u2019 formula to make them so unbreakable? But then again, besides the Hill\u2019s pellet\u2019s compactness and roughness, I do not know if the issue with Hill\u2019s dog food is that some of its ingredients are highly allergenic. So be careful, watch your dog\u2019s behavior and if it drools and has seizures after eating, look no more, it is very likely his food. Be strong and do not succumb to your veterinarian pressure to put your dog under epileptic drugs. First try finding the right food before you put your dog under such harsh drugs. I hope I am able to save the reader from frightening and sad events like mine and in the process preserve a dog\u2019s health and save its life.",

A while back my dog would become randomly sick, shooting liquid lava like poop from himself while making a horrible balloon popping sound. It would happen on and off. Took him to a vet the first time, they said he must\u0027ve ate something bad. Resumed our normal schedule. He became sick again later. Took him to another vet who diagnosed him properly, we were given an $80 bag of Royal Canin which completely cured all digestive issues along with the use of a powered prebiotic and antibiotics for safety measures. When it came time to reorder dog food I had hoped there was a cheaper alternative out there to Royal Canine that wouldn\u0027t upset his tummy. Hill\u0027s Science dog food (sensitive stomach and skin recipe, chicken flavor) proved it\u0027s worth. It was like I had not switched him from Royal Canin at all. Now that we\u0027re running low on the small bag of Hill\u0027s I initially ordered I\u0027m ordering the large 30lb bag. Very very pleased with this company, I\u0027m hoping that this review also helps dog parents in my similar position find a good replacement food for the Royal Canin. It works just the same and costs less!",

    "body": "Best Dog Food Ever! My family and I recently adopted a 3-year-old pit bull from our local shelter. The shelter originally gave him Hill\u0027s Science Diet and gave us a small bag to take home with us.  We switched over to the other brand after finishing the bag, I bought him another dog food called \u0022Gentle Giants World Class Canine Nutrition Dog and Puppy Food Classic Quality of Life Chicken Feast\u0022. That was a big mistake, my dog had a terrible experience with the dog food. He had diarrhea almost every day. I had to wake up early in the morning to clean his bed of poop. If it wasn\u0027t diarrhea, it was vomit and he would be vomiting out small portions of the food. He would also have very irregular poops that ranged from watery to a poop that could barely hold a shape. It was a terrible experience that lasted 2 months. I thought it was just my dog specifically who was having these problems because we just got him from the shelter. When we got him, he was freshly neutered and was emaciated, but that wasn\u0027t the case at all. After switching back over to Hill\u0027s my dog\u0027s health has changed tremendously, starting from day one! He now has more regular poops and no longer vomits or has diarrhea in the middle of the night. I highly recommend this brand of dog food. If your pet is having stomach troubles or any skin troubles like mine [he\u0027s a pitbull, a lot of them usually have little bumps on their skin or other problems because their skin is sensitive] this \u0022Hill\u0027s Science Diet Dry Dog Food, Adult, Sensitive Stomach \u0026 Skin Recipes\u0022 is the best!",

I immediately realized that Science Diet truly is the best dog food. Sure, it\u0027s not grain free or holistic or whatever other nonsense is popular these days, but it keeps my dogs in perfect condition and they\u0027ve never had a single problem eating it. I use this because one of my dogs has itchy skin and while it doesn\u0027t make it completely go away, it lessens it so that it\u0027s bearable. This food has created many Champions and all around healthy family pets from my litters. After the Blue Buffalo incident, I will never use any other dog food.",

My dog is not a picky eater by any means, but she LOVES this food and it has made her a healthy girl! I adopted my pup from the Bahamas when I was a veterinary technician. She was VERY thin when I got her and her fur was dull, she had constant Gastrointestinal issues and even after hundreds in veterinary bills and after several dewormings and rounds of probiotics, the damage done to her GI tract from her days on the streets seemed irreversible... She had bloody diarrhea and her belly would rumble so strongly that I could see it from the outside!  Since I switched her to this food her gastrointestinal issues have seemed to disappear besides the occasional diarrhea when she is very stressed, her fur is also much shinier, her skin is less itchy, and she is a perfect body condition score! Now that I am a veterinary student, I usually get a large discount on this food through the Hill\u0027s VIP website, but due to COVID, their shipping has been very unreliable (took 3 MONTHS for a 5 day order!) and Amazon will overnight it to me for free as a Prime member, so it is worth it because I would not put my baby girl on any other food! Pictures show before (first pic on the red tile at shelter) and after (pic in office chair 1 year after adoption). Just in case you wonder if I\u0027m paid off by Hill\u0027s, no way! I will never accept a sponsorship although my tuition is about $200,000, I want pet owners to trust my recommendations!",

    "body": "This food Saved my Relationship My boyfriend moved in a few months ago with his 35 lb Aussie. I was super excited to get a new boo AND a new dog, until I discover that one of them had a terrible diarrhea problem. His beautiful dog (haha bet you thought this was about him) would have an episode at least once a week where she\u0027d end up with puddles of rancid smelling, liquified dookie in the bottom of her crate. It was so bad sometimes, it would splatter out of the crate and surrounding floor and even wall. He said she\u0027d always had that problem, despite trying different kinds of food. The one she had been eating was the \u0022best so far\u0022, he said. If the \u0022best\u0022 we can do means blasting crap all over my walls once a month, well, that\u0027s just not acceptable.Something had to give. I couldn\u0027t keep living like this. So, after doing some research, I decided to give this one a shot. Totally. Worth. It. Since we have switched (very gradually over two weeks), and 8 weeks on HSD only, we\u0027ve only had one(!!) poop episode and even then it was totally manageable.Now that I\u0027ve written this I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll have one tomorrow.

    "body": "Finally listened to vet and glad I did Our english bulldog puppy had terribly loose stools when we first got her and fed her breeder recommended Royal Canin. I stayed with that for a while then transferred her to Honest Kitchen. She loved that food but the work involved for mixing and storing had its drawbacks. Our vet carried Hills Science Diet, but I had read online that vets were paid to carry it, so instead I read, and read, and read everything I could get my hands on and finally decided to try a grain free food for our dog. She loved it, her stools were great, her coat was perfect, and we thought we found the solution. Till she developed a rash...and I took her to the vet and he asked what I was feeding her.i was so frustrated at the process we had undergone to find the perfect food only for her to get a rash, I told him I was not feeding her HIS recommended Hills Science Diet. He looked at me and told me grain free dog foods are now being linked to canine heart disease! I took a bag of Hills Sensitive Stomach just to appease him as I pondered what I would do with the 50 pound bag of \u0022bad\u0022 grain-free food I had just ordered!!  I came home and did more research only to find our vet was our dogs best friend. The food i was using was very high quality, but was also on the list as one of the worst I could choose for heart disease. As I read in another post, TALK TO YOUR VET. TRUST YOUR VET! I had been told Science Diet paid vets to carry their product, and provided scholarships to vet students if they promoted their product. I still don\u0027t know if this is true but our dog is thriving, her coat is beautiful, she cannot get enough of this food, and her stools are perfectly solid and no longer runny. Bulldogs have their own set of problems and ours has not been the exception, but I literally am indebted to our vet for directing us to Science Diet. It will give us our dog for many years to come and hope others will try this before heart disease takes their furry friend.",

I recently switched my old dog over to this food due to chronic stomach problems he has been having the last couple months with nausea/regurgitation/acid reflux/diarrhea (he has been dewormed regularly, on antibiotics and probiotics for diarrhea, on hernia occassionally for nausea, and omeprazole for acid reflux, but still having recurrent problems). My vet recommended seeing how he does on a sensitive stomach food before taking further action. The food has helped tremendously with these issues and he finally has an appetite again! I haven\u0027t seen loose stools in a couple weeks and I havent seen him regurgitate his food at all in a couple weeks either. He is also very picky about food and will happily starve himself if food smells unappetizing, but he seems to love this stuff! It almost has a kind of cheesy smell (he loves cheese). It smells better than your typical dog food and both bags I\u0027ve bought so far seem to be very fresh, not \u0022stale.\u0022 Would definitely recommend to anyone who has dogs with stomach problems!",
