I\u0027m not an amateur K9 nutritionist like so many claim to be, but over my 30\u002B years of dog ownership I\u0027ve fed my dogs just about every brand of food on the market.  I have not had a dog die prematurely for any reason other than old age (typically 15-16 yrs).  So I don\u0027t buy into all these advertised health claims as it pertains to things like \u0027more energy, shiny coats, longer life, better digestion etc etc etc).  I simply choose a reputable brand of food that my dogs enjoy with good value and go with it.  All that being said, this is by far a larger volume of food in a 40lb bag that most others of the same weight.  By volume I mean 40lbs of this stuff takes up more space than most other brands.  If you transfer the contents from the bag into lidded 5-gal food grade buckets like I do, just know that 2 buckets is not enough.  You\u0027ll need 3.",

Our dogs love the food/flavor and it works for.both our large and small.dog.  We have the subscription service currently in place.  The current bag we had opened we didn\u0027t notice any issues, until recently we started finding what appeared to be maggots on our pantry/near where we keep the dog food.  Of course we freaked out because we aren\u0027t dirty people and it made us sick.  We inspected everything including the dogs, cleaned everything we possibly could think of, and didn\u0027t initially find the source until just yesterday. I noticed small webs in the actual bag of dog food, and after doing some research it appears to be pantry moth eggs and larvae/maggots that were in the dry dog food.  We immediately threw it all out which sucks because it was almost a full bag and wasn\u0027t cheap because we get the large 31 lb bags.  Luckily, we were able to get another bag right away from the store.  I inspected the new bag, and it appears to be okay.  I am pretty upset bc our boxer has been acting sickly/ having watery BMs ever since that bag was opened. I don\u0027t know if we should wean them off the brand, stop the subscription and buy local, or what?  I am pretty upset tho, not only for losing the money, but for having to deal with the gross infestation and for my poor pup having issues.",

At the recommendation of a dog park acquaintance, we picked up a bag of this to try.  Sure enough, within 1 bag, we noticed much less paw/foot licking.  Not sure what it was in those other foods (maybe sweet potato?), but we\u0027re happy to be spending less on food and having our dog happier and more comfortable.",

However:  my dogs eat it and don\u0027t throw it up...except for when the big one gets car sick (ugh). I used to make my dog food from pork, carrots, peas and brown rice.  the dogs\u0027 coats were shiny and no problems with eating and keeping the food down.  With medical issues I couldn\u0027t do it any longer.  I tried several other brands which my goldendoodle threw up. It irks me that the dog kibble is what I fed my dogs, a bunch of vitamins added, ground up and cut into small pieces and dried.  That is my interpretation, anyway, when I read the ingredients.  Enough of my rant.  The food works, all are healthy.",

I haven\u2019t had any problems until I bought this bag off of Amazon and it was a 30\u002B pound bag so it\u2019ll last quite awhile. Well I noticed she has been throwing up everyday just about after feeding her and I thought maybe she got into something so just to rule a couple things out I decided to stop feeding her this food for a day or two and she didn\u2019t throw up. After that I gave her half a serving that I would usually give her and just like I thought she threw up so this big ol bag of food I bought was a waste and I ended up switching her to grain free food that is about the same price and she loves it.

For a few weeks, I found little black beetles EVERYWHERE in my house, we could not figure out where they were coming from until one day I opened the dog food container and there were at least 10. We dumped the container out to find maggots crawling everywhere along with the beetles. I do believe they came from either the amazon warehouse or somewhere in transit.I have nothing wrong with Purina its self, they produce good dog food that my pets love.

There were no issues with the first couple deliveries, but this last one was different. The dog food has little white specs in it. Initially, we thought it was an additive not completely mixed in or something new to the formula, but a month into using it and half way through the bag, we have found bugs and insect larvae crawling around inside the food bin. We do not have the original packaging to provide a lot number. I don\u0027t know if this is something that happened because of an Amazon storage issue or a production problem with Purina. My faith in the product is strong. I immediately purchased another bag of Purina One to replace this one, but it was from Walmart, not Amazon. I have cancelled my subscription because of this. The couple dollars I saved using Amazon will be more than offset my veterinarian bills.",

I immediately stopped her on the BB food and switched to this. Within less than a day, she was pretty much completely recovered and has had no digestive issues since. The other dog had been eating wet food mixed in with dry food because she wouldn\u0027t eat just the dry food. With this food, both dogs get so excited to eat and scarf it down so fast. I did some research on BB and would never let an animal eat their products ever again. I fully trust and stand by this product by Purina though!

It started off fine and we blended it slowly with the old food before exclusively serving it. When we started to give only this to our dogs (50 lb- 9 year old Mutt and 20 lb- 4 year old terrier mix) it was AWFUL. Our 9 year old dog got horribly sick. He was lethargic but couldn\u2019t get comfortable because of how uncontrollably itchy he was. He also had horrible diarrhea that he struggled to get out and spent the better part of 2-3 throwing up. We took the food away to see if that was the issue and sure enough it was. We found the Lamb and Rice formula elsewhere and haven\u2019t had a problem since. I do not recommend this food.",

I had to rewrite this review because amazon removed the other one over concerns that I was lying about this product not being authentic Purina food. They said I received genuine dog food and I know what I feed my dog, not them. This food was not authentic, and it was so much worse quality than what I get at the store that it made my dog vomit only minutes after eating her normal portion. If you care about your dog, buy this from the store and make sure it\u0027s real because this product is not and will probably make your dog sick. I\u0027m only trying to warn everyone because I don\u0027t want your dogs to get sick and Amazon doesn\u0027t care as long as they get top dollar for selling their fake products.

I mix this in with puppy food so she can get the nutrients she needs and also to get her used to her future food as I plan to stick with this great dog food for the foreseeable future.It actually smells really good.
