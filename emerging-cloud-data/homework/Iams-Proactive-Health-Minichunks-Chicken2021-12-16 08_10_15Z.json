We fostered a dog who had been starved to within hours of death \u0026 fed him this along with actual live cultures to build his stomach back up. All of our dogs have beautiful healthy coats \u0026 no skin issues. Our 1 black lab lived to be nearly 18 \u0026 our Aussie Shepherd to 14\u002B and I firmly believe Iams is the biggest reason for their longevity. Our Aussie used to have constant ear infections \u0026 when I switched her over to the Iams (green bag) they ended.

I got it for my puppy who seems to have a sensitive stomach. This one sat pretty well with him and I started to see his stool better in consistency and his coat was visibly shinier.

BUT it could be better on the ingredients- I usually buy him Crave with less fillers \u0026 35\u002B% or so protein, until the price went up last month.. I also have to feed him 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 cups of Iams to 2 1/2 cups of Crave per day, so the 22lb bag of Crave pretty much equals this 30lb bag of Iams \u0026 less \u0022waste\u0022 to pick up, less food to store, less doggy waste bags to buy, etc.. So- pretty much divided on the 2- if I can find Crave for close to what I paid for this, I\u0027ll go with the Crave every time.. A little disappointed since Iams is so much bigger \u0026 well known (\u0026 has been in business much longer) \u0026 should have a competitive product for the same price or less.",

I have read enough on the subject that I feel comfortable choosing what I believe to be a healthy middle ground product.Cheaper dog foods seem to require larger amounts per serving to get the nutrients needed and dogs go to the bathroom more because of all the \u0022filler\u0022 they are ingesting.  Over the years I\u0027ve seen this with a few other brands I\u0027ve tried.More expensive brands may contain even  less filler but are awfully expensive ($/pound) and I haven\u0027t seen any long term benefit in my experiences.  I know some families over the years who only buy top brands and I do not see them having any less health issues or any longer life spans than anyone else I know.To me, Iams is a good quality middle grade dog food that all my dogs over the years have done well on.Shipper:  Always packed well and arrives on time.  Is normally around the $1/lb price point for a 30 lb bag and is one less thing I need to juggle in the grocery cart by having it shipped via Amazon. A\u002B",

Our mini schnauzer lived 18 years and, for the most part, this is the only brand he ate. Our Golden doodle loves the mini-chunks. We tried getting him to eat the larger size or a different brand, but mini-chunks is his favorite. He\u2019s healthy and he has beautiful, full coat. Also, I\u2019ve noticed that his turds are consistent when he eats IAMS. My husband bought a cheaper brand ONCE and we noticed a distinct difference in his poopie consistency and the stench of his fluffy toots. I can only imagine the tummy ache he had from the sub-par brand. We will be staying with IAMS mini-chunks from now on. I recommend IAMS to anyone who cares about their dogs health and happiness.",

He never had a health problem and was in such great shape into his old age. We called him our forever young puppy! Unfortunately he got into some moldy human food at age 18, resulting in kidney damage. After the kidney damage the vet recommended switching him to a lower protein kibble, so we switched to Hills Science Diet. But when people ask me my recommendations for a dog\u0027s long and healthy life, I always tell them Iams, and limited table scraps and treats.",
