But, we\u0027ve received bags twice through Amazon that she won\u0027t eat and/or has caused her to throw up. Once we opened another bag she ate it. My best guess is that it\u0027s stale or moldy, although mold wasn\u0027t visible. Once we returned it for a refund and the 2nd time we waited too long to report it to return it. We\u0027re going to try buying it from chewy and see if that fixes the problem. We\u0027ve always given our dogs science diet without incident before this, so I can only deduce it\u0027s a bad batch or how it\u0027s stored by the supplier.",

We had an entire blood panel and x rays done at the vets thinking he ate something and all tests came back normal. It wasn\u0027t until I stopped feeding him the dog food and switched him to something else that he stopped throwing up.

I prefer buying a large bag because if you are feeding a large breed active dog, they eat quite a bit and you go through food faster than a medium or small dog. When she was a bit underweight the Vet. said, \u0022You can start upping her food to 3.5 cups now, I laughed and said, \u0022 She has been eating 5 cups a day now for over a year and I\u0027m just not going to give her any more than that!\u0022  The Vet looked surprised and said, \u0022Wow.\u0022 My dog is now almost 6, still active, and still eating approx. 5 cups a day and at her optimum weight.Thanks Amazon for making it easy to keep her fed.",

    "body": "Best dry food for my dogs I have found I have tried other, costly dog foods in the last couple of years. My oldest pup has cancer, and I\u2019m doing everything I can to find him the highest quality dog food to both keep him happy in the time he has left, and as healthy as possible. That said, I have two others (all three are rescues) and their health and happiness is just as important to me.Let me say this, and I hope you hear me: Blue Buffalo makes all three of my dogs sick! From their food and their treats, my dogs had it coming out both ends within 24 hours of eating their products. Now, as I said, I had  been shopping around, looking for the best food I could afford that I could feed to all of them. Science Diet has won, hands down!All three of my dogs love the taste. They seem to have better energy, better muscle, and a better skin/coat on this food than any other food I have tried. I highly recommend this brand and specifically this product to anyone with a dog. It is pricier than others on the market, but it\u2019s my opinion that it is well worth it. Here\u2019s why:When I was feeding them the cheaper dry food, like Old Roy, Purina etc, the dogs ate the full 4 cups I put out for them and still acted hungry. They had bad dandruff and hot spots, and their shedding was out of control.Once I put them on Science Diet, they only eat half of what I give them and are content and they are actually healthier.So I\u2019m buying half the amount a month I was buying before switching. It actually ends up being cheaper. Hope this helped",

Unlike many brands of dog food, he did not have any problems with gas in the hours after consuming the food.Our overweight, elderly beagle Todd, who always greets any new thing with skepticism, eyeballed the food before tentatively taking a bite. He then gobbled up the rest of it, with no later gas issues.Our nervous mutt Calvin, the most finicky of the group, had no problem eating this food; he did not even give it a suspicious look, as he usually does with new things.Our boys liked the food, and it did appear to be of very good quality, thus we were pleased to feed it to them.I was also pleased with the easy-to-open packaging, which saved some wear-and-tear on my hands!  Less pleasing was the price of Hill\u0027s Science Diet products in general, though I found Amazon\u0027s pricing to be competitive with the big-box pet stores in my area.Based on my boys\u0027 \u0022review\u0022 and my own impression of this food, I recommend this chicken and barley recipe from Hill\u0027s Science Diet!",
