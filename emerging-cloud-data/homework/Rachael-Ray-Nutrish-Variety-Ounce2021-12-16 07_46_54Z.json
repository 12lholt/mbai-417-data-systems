My dog has always been a picky eater as he ages he\u2019s even pickier, but he loves this food and is always asking for his dinner early when before he would turn his nose up at his dish and go take a nap instead of eating. I was throwing away more dog food than he was eating and at todays prices for dog food it was getting very expensive. I don\u2019t throw away dog food anymore.",

I decided that I wanted to find a healthier alternative for wet dog food but every product label that I read all had fillers as their main ingredients. I was about to give up when I finally came across Nutrish and I\u2019m so happy that I did. This dog food is amazing and I would highly recommend ordering it, what I love the most is that it has real whole pieces of carrots, peas and the meat is shredded in a gravy. I buy the variety pack that comes with chicken, beef and lamb which is loves all three of, I haven\u2019t ordered the other meat choices but I\u2019m sure they are just as great. It\u2019s also a big plus that it comes in a easy resealable container so no more using Tupperware or the other pet lids you can buy for normal dog food cans. Over all the food, ingredients, packaging and quality all get a A\u002B from me.",

I searched reviews when for the last few days, my 3yr old/13lb PomChi has started having mini pees inside and I noticed she\u0027s wanting out every 30-60mins and seems to be taking a long time to pee...I found a review with a similar issue...I just bought 2 cases but these are going in trash today. I ordered cranberry chews hoping to prevent a vet visit! And I also just ordered Hill\u0027s Science \u0026 Blue Buffalo wet food as both are MADE IN USA. Both my dogs loved this food...we tried variety first then went with the chicken paw as it appeared to be shredded chicken with gravy, green beans...but, I read it no longer made in USA so it\u0027s all just too scary for me.",

I\u0027ve also washed the sturdy container to reuse to make individual packages of kibble when we \u0022wanna go for a ride in the car\u0022! Additionally she likes the taste of the food. Not that I\u0027m going to taste it but it doesn\u0027t have that nasty dog food smell. I wouldn\u0027t want to give her anything like that. This brand actually smells like a nice stew.

She is not ever enthusiastic about any dry kibble food but when it goes for wet food ,she hardly ever rejects it . I trusted the brand and work of rachel ray\u0060s dog food and i ordered this with confidence . But in first glance after opening the first container which was chicken , i found the texture absolutely bizarre. It smeled, looked and felt like ANYTHING but chicken. I opened the beef container , and it WAS THE SAME. It looked and smelled and felt SO ROUGH AND HARD and when i touched it with my hand i was grossed out. I let my dog be the judge and she didnt even want to sniff it. So, i don\u0060t even know what this product is made of. DUNKY\u0060s meat or camel\u0060s meat ?

My dog used to be excited for food, as most dogs are, but now when I open these, she comes running, sniffs the food and walks away. Eventually she\u2019ll get around to eating it, but not by choice. It also gives her terrible diarrhea and she has horrendous gas \u0026 breath. It\u2019s legitimately all flavors. Once I switched to another brand, all these problems went away almost immediately. They must have changed to formula or recipe along the way without saying something. Sadly, won\u2019t be purchasing anymore.",

To make each tub last a bit, I\u0027ll use about 1/3 of the tub with each meal (2x per day) and mix in some water with the meat to loosen it up/make some gravy.

With that being said, it never occurred to me it was the food and not just my dog (because he does like to eat cat poop ..we literally call him the turd burglar), but he threw up twice today both times right after eating. It might be the food. After reading some of the reviews, I\u2019ve seen other Pet parents complaining of this and now I\u2019m putting two and two together due to this not being the first time he\u2019s thrown up shortly after eating. I really hope it\u2019s just my dog and not the food because it took a long time to find something he didn\u2019t sniff and stick his nose up at.

That night he was acting really weird - he was all over me acting very weird - lethargic - nervous ears and face. I knew something was wrong. I stayed up with him then he walked nervously to the door and had terrible TMI loud diarrhea and I could also TMI smell it from the porch. This food tore up his stomach. I threw the rest away. I was wary since it was from Thailand and the meat looked strange to me. My other bigger dog has been fine so far. But I will not purchase this in the future.",

It was very early so after an IV for fluids, anti-nausea medicine and prescription grade low fat dog food he recovered. But seriously don\u0027t buy this. It is super high fat and can cause serious issues in dogs. After some more deep research I found several other people that had serious health issues and even death related to this dog food. I consider myself lucky we caught it early and there was no long-term damage. No one should buy this dog food brand.",

I do not know why people are looking at that as such a negative thing. WHAT is the problem? The ingredients are LISTED on their site, the label, etc. i have seen so many reviews from different sites complimenting this dog food brand. Im shocked to see that just because of where the product was made, people want to have an issue with it! Does it SAY it was made in america?! Ridiculous ! REGARDLESS of where it was made, i changed my dog\u2019s wet food to this brand for a reason. Its 10x healthier \u0026 natural than what they were originally eating. They have no upset stomachs, no health issues or anything when they started eating this brand. The only problem i have with this food is the portion size \u0026 the packaging! A lot of caps/plastic being used, i think there can be better packaging than that. But that is the only complaint i have. I would recommend the shredded chicken (green container) to dog owners. My dogs absolutely love that one specifically. I mix a small portion of this with dry food as well to get their nutrients in.",

They prefer these flavors and textures over the \u0022Dish\u0022 variety, I think because it is less processed-seeming and less soupy than \u0022Dish\u0022. My dogs are very picky eaters, I am constantly working to keep them happy. They\u0027ve tried more than 20 varieties of canned and refrigerated dog-log type dinners. \u0022Nutrish\u0022 wins out as the favorite. And I can see why, it looks really nice. Other than the cost, which is kind of high for the small portion size, my other complaint is the excessive plastic packaging. I tried to switch to \u0022Dish\u0022 for that reason, (that packaging is simpler and not plastic), but my dogs don\u0027t love it as much! Maybe at least get rid of the lid?
