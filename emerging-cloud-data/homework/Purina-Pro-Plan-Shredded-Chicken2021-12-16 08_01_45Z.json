    "body": "buyer beware First let me say that I have purchased this dog food for both of my dogs for the last 6 years. So I am a LOYAL purina pro plan customer and have only ever used this brand. We have always loved it\u2026until the last couple of months. I\u2019ve ALWAYS had their food stored in airtight containers, but recently I noticed there was bugs and worms in the food. Like not just a few bugs\u2026.I mean like infested with bugs and worms. So because I\u2019m such a loyal customer that has loved purina, I thought there\u2019s no way it could be the manufacturer\u2019s fault. I figured I just needed to buy new vacuum sealed containers and that maybe my current containers had an issue. Let me also say that my house is incredibly clean and we don\u2019t have any bugs anywhere else in the house. So I spent money on the top of the line food containers designed to keep out bugs. Then, I checked when I opened a new bag of purina, and I saw the bugs in the bag before I even poured it into my container. That\u2019s when I knew the bug/worm infestation was not our container problem\u2026but a Purina problem. I reported it to amazon and got a refund. Then, I still purchased more purina because I figured maybe it was just a bad batch. Well, now my last 2 orders also had bugs. One of them is outside the return window so I\u2019m frustrated. Honestly my dogs love this food so if I get a response from Purina with how they are going to fix this, I am willing to remain a customer because I know mistakes happen. But if not, I\u2019m going to have to transition my dogs to a different food unfortunately. Or maybe buy it directly from Petco and not amazon?",

I\u2019m not sure if it is the way it\u2019s stored, shipped or sold but the food is contaminated. Please read the reviews before making your fur baby ill. I went and bought the same locally and he is doing somewhat better. He was actually scarfing the new bag and had some energy. I never would\u2019ve thought this would happen.

It\u0027s been so bad on our dog that we have decided to stop pro plan immediately and will be switching back to the local warehouse dog food we had been using prior to this without any issues.

One beetle lays 150 eggs\u2026 you will see these bugs EVERYWHERE in your home and your dog can get sick or even DIE (according to some of the reviews I read).",

I got home and thought she was going to die, lethargic. Did not want to move. She usually has a lot of energy and she had zero. Her poop was very soft, not quite diarrhea. I thought I was upgrading to give her her better food. Never again. I had to call the vet at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning and almost make an emergency visit and she said to wait until the next morning which I did and my dog started to feel better, thank God. The picture is of the bag I threw in the trash because I would not want to give it to someone else and have their dog exposed to this.

I thought about 4 months ago that only the bag design had changed and could not find anything on the formula having changed. When I opened a new bag about a 2 and 1/2 months or so ago, my dogs started vomiting after eating, then wouldn\u0027t touch the food at all. I thought it was their vitamins since I had opened a new package of that also. Then one dog (golden retriever) started leaving food in her bowl which she has never done in 10 years!! Then when both dogs stopped eating completely, I began researching and found hundreds of FB posts  (on the Purina page) and Reddit posts about other peoples dogs getting sick! This was a good brand until they changed the formula. Although I changed the food, it was too late for my golden retriever and she ended up with kidney failure within a month after I fed her that food and ended up dying last month. Since I don\u0027t have definitive proof it was the food, I can\u0027t really blame them, but I am highly suspicious since both dogs got sick at the same exact time and stayed sick until I got them onto different food.",

I have a large boxer/german shepherd mix dog and in her older age she has become very picky with the food she eats. We decided to try this dog food for her and she likes it! She normally likes to have a topper or some wet food mixed in with her dry food and this one is the same way. She doesn\u0027t like it enough to just eat it plain. Overall I think it is a good dog food. I think the price is a little high at $15 for 4lb bag.",

    "body": "Very comparable to Purina One Smartblend. My dog loves this Pro Plan food. We had been using another Purina dog food for our pet for years (Purina One SmartBlend True Instinct Chicken flavor). Unfortunately, it was just discontinued, so we asked our vet\u2019s what he recommended, and he said that Purina Pro Plan by name first, and said it was in his top three. Since this dog food is so close to what our dog is already eating, we decided this would be a good bag to try out.We gave it to her by introducing a bit at a time in with her Purina One food and she had no trouble accepting or digesting it. The kibble in this Purina Pro Plan food is bigger than we\u2019re used to, so if you have a tiny dog (5 pounds or less), this may be a consideration for you.As with Purina ONE, this Pro Plan food\u2019s main ingredient is Chicken, followed by meat by-product. For the record, that means ground up chicken carcasses so\u2026 use your imagination. It does add to the protein percentage but it\u2019s pretty gross to think about beaks and chicken feet and stuff being fed to your pet. This Pro Plan food also contains rice, which is good for their digestive tract. It also contains Omega-6 for a healthy skin and coat and probiotics to promote healthy bacteria in the gut (not sure if the probiotics works in food at room temperature but it isn\u0027t hurting - no loose stools since we switched).As far as how this tastes: I don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m not about to find out. As long as my dog scarfs it down, that\u0027s good enough for me.This food has an ok percentage of protein, fat, and fiber for commercial dog food. There is slightly (like 1%) more protein in this than the Purina One.Since thiat product has been working for her, we\u2019re going to switch to this product rather than try some new product that may not agree with her sensitive stomach. It\u0027s only about 50 cents more expensive for this six pound bag at the current time than the food we had been ordering, so the price is almost a wash too.I am not in love with the animal bi-product, but its very common in dog food and I\u2019ll try not to think about it. You may find a better product out there at a much higher price point,, but this product is a quality food and it is at a good price point.",

There is the regular triangular shaped kibble pieces that most dogs food are comprised of but then there are also these little shredded pieces. They emulate the texture and shapes of regular meat that your dog would typically be chewing in the wild from its prey.  They look like little riffed off pieces of flesh, which dogs like. Does my dog really notice the difference when he eats this? I have no idea.  Either way, however, he really seems to like this and has had no problem scarfing it down when I feed it to himAs far as the ingredient list is concerned, this seems to include all the nutrition my dog needs and it covers a wide variety of vitamins and minerals as well as probiotics and even L- Lysine, which is very good for the immune system.  The only reason I didn\u0027t rate this a full 5 stars is because I am not extremely fond of the by products, soybean meal or corn gluten. I prefer to give my dog his fibre and carbohydrates from more cleaner sources but he seems to be doing well on this.",

My two Great Pyrenees have had stomach and skin issues since the get go and the vet had thought it was food allergies. I\u0027ve been all over the gambit trying out foods. High protein, allergy free, carnivore, etc. My two livestock dogs are litter mates, so they share genetics and seem to have similar stool and skin issues with digging, itching, and scaling. I\u0027ve tried quite a few formulas and nothing seems to ease it up as much as the Purina Sensitive. They\u0027re doing well with high protein mixed in with their old food working my way up, but I don\u0027t think their skin and coat look as well as when they do the strictly sensitive formula.This has corn, soy, and wheat in it which are known as some of the top allergy issues in our breed. I am concerned that perhaps this is what is still causing some of the issues because they do so well on the sensitive formula, and they do moderately okay with the high protein. I\u0027m torn because they gobble this up, but I think they\u0027re digging more with this than just the sensitive formula.I tried strictly carnivore for a couple weeks, but there was still some skin issues, then as well so I went back to commercial feed at the vet recommendation to get the extra vitamins and minerals. Dogs are actually omnivores by build and their own diet in nature, so I think I was leaving something out.At any rate, this did show some improvements, but not as much as the one formulated just for a sensitive skin and stomach. If you have an active puppers, I think this is great and might do well to ease some stool and stomach issues. If you think it\u0027s food allergies, perhaps try the sensitive instead. I\u0027d get this again, but I\u0027d like to try this formula with higher protein and without the corn, soy, or wheat to see if it\u0027s one of those top three causing the major itching and digging.",

    "body": "Love this dog food! I\u2019ve had my golden retriever for three years now and ever since he was a puppy he has never wanted to eat his meals until now. He started off on Authority Chicken and rice puppy formula, after he decided he didn\u2019t want to eat his food anymore we tried Earthborn Holistic Grain free salmon recipe, even with this high quality food he was extremely picky and never ate a whole meal at once. Then after the FDA list of grain free foods causing DCM was published, I worried too often about his heart and switched to Farmina (highly recommended by concord pet supply workers) chicken and pumpkin recipe, he chose to rarely eat this also, and it ended up giving him extremely bad diarrhea for a few weeks and he had to be put on medications by our vet. From there I decided to switch to Earthborn Holistic Smoked Salmon with ancient grains, now this fixed up his tummy issues, but he still chose to rarely eat. I had honestly just chalked it up to him being spoiled, and not wanting to eat as he also had no food drive for our dog sports. After joining a page on Facebook called Pet Vet Corner run by real vets who have studied nutrition, I picked through their very specific list of dog foods for what I thought might fit him best and chose Purina Pro Plan. Although I have never bought this food directly from Amazon (as I worry that they store the food weird which is causing the mold issues), I have never had an issue anywhere else. I\u2019ve bought this food from Tractor supply and I would also trust Petsmart. My dog now eats every meal immediately. He loves his food, he actually wants to eat, and he looks amazing! If anything changes I will update, but he\u2019s been eating it for over a month and I have never been more amazed with a dog food.",

I have ordered several items and am amazed how quickly things arrive to my home which is in a town of 4000 people. I have an 8 year old 100-lb golden retriever and have been using purina pro plan for his entire life. Today I received my second delivery of this dog food through Amazon and unfortunately it had a slit in the side of the bag from what appears to be a box cutter that resulted in the dog food being all over the inside of the box. This was the first item I\u2019ve received from Amazon that was damaged and not having a ton of experience with Amazon as well as being frustrated that the dog food arrived in this condition, I went to the chat function for customer service to tell them my experience. The customer service was extremely fast and remediated the situation in less than a minute much to my surprise. Very impressed with Amazon\u2019s customer service and their business model. Upon receiving the package today, I was skeptical in ordering further dog food from Amazon but this quick and essentially effortless experience with customer service renewed my newfound trust in such a great company that takes care of their customers with little to no questions asked. Highly recommend anyone considering not lugging around heavy dog food bags anymore to give Amazon a try given their competitive prices and excellent customer service able to remediate any issues that are unlikely to come your way.",

We ordered this on \u201Csubscription\u201D from amazon thinking we love the dog food and never have issues purchasing from pet stores but why not add it to our amazon prime. WRONG. We have had two bags (purchased and shipped months apart) that have both caused our poor dog to have explosive diarrhea, the first so bad she ended up in dog urgent care and had to have IVs for hydration. This second bag I was more weary of but was hopeful and within two days (and we made sure not to change anything else about her diet, activity, whereabouts... more explosive, painful poops).We have had ZERO problems with purchasing from PETCO. I\u2019m not sure how these bags are being stored or transferred when purchased but something is obviously wrong here.We use this brand and continue to purchase from Store retailers, not Amazon and affiliate and have no GI issues or unhealthy, uncomfortable, bowel movements.Take my advice... if you don\u2019t want to see you dog in discomfort or be up with them at all hours of the night because they have hot lava coming out their booty holes, I suggest you don\u2019t buy online!",

The doctor recommended this brand as his fur was really suffering with his allergies. He is doing pretty good with this brand since then. This was the third time I got his food from Amazon, and the only time I had issues with it was the second time, when I could not find any of the shreds inside of the food. This one was pretty much good so we are happy with this purchase.",

However after a month or so, he wasnt excited to eat it and just would leave the bowl full of food all day but just love and beg for treats. I reduced his feedings, as well changing the times just incase that was a factor. I ended up having to add beef broth so he would eat it.I wanted to find a food with the same nutritional content as well as something that tasted good for him. He loves it, they have different forms of the kibble, as well as more than just one plain flavor so I can switch it up on him easily. Plus its a little cheaper than science diet which is really nice",

They are really active and eat a lot.I just got my own Shih Tzu and opted to buy this dog food on her recommendation. It is not grain free, but she told me that some grain-free dog foods have been known to cause health issues in dogs. Given that my dog will be fine eating small amounts of bread, and seems to love rice, I thought I would give this one a go.The instructions recommend a transition period between the dog\u0027s old food and new food. Because I was nearly out of old food, I just went straight to this one, and added a little bit of salmon oil. Though I am sure he would prefer to eat people food, he really likes this combination. I buy the chicken one, but my sister buys the lamb one for her dogs as one of them has severe allergies.",

His entire life, it has taken him at least 24 hours to eat his daily ration of Sport and then he would carry it all over the house to eat a mouthful at a time when he felt like it. It also gave him fish breath that would take your breath. The Savor, now that is a different story. He stands at the bowl as soon as it hits the floor and doesn\u0027t move from it until the bowl is empty. He worries me to death in the  evenings wanting to be fed now. I don\u0027t really see any difference in his energy level, hair quality, shedding, no allergies... but on the plus side, no bad breath and no gas either!",

I\u2019ve been feeding him another variety of Purina Pro Plan for about 8mths now, but recently he became extremely ill with some kind of gastrointestinal sickness. He was pooping and vomiting blood, and I thought that I was going to lose him. Luckily, after $500 at the vet, he made a full recovery. While going through this whole ordeal, my vet recommended that I give him probiotics, so I decided to search for a dry dog food that contained probiotics. I was thrilled when I discovered that the brand of dog food that I was already feeding him carried a variety containing probiotics. I bought this shredded chicken variety, and like I said earlier, he absolutely loves it. I will definitely continue to feed him this variety of Purina Pro Plan unless he\u2019s runs into some unforeseen issue with it in the future. Thank you Amazon and thank you Purina.",
