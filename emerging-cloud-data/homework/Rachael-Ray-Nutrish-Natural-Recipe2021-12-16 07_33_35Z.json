I bought this bag, after buying the chicken flaver, and my dogs didn\u0027t want to chew it. So I put the food in a bag and hammered it to brake it up into smaller pieces. It didn\u0027t even brake!!! So my take is that it\u0027s not a good product. Specially if your dog is telling you, they can\u0027t bite into it! Think I\u0027m going to YouTube the healthy recipes for dogs, from now on.",

At first we thought maybe it was because they had been fed by our neighbor and not hungry.. then we thought, maybe they are eating wild animals (we live in the country and they roam freely).. then we thought, maybe the food was stale??? so we opened a brand new bag.

The new 40lb bag that I just opened the kibbles are larger and there is some difference in the colors of the kibbles; mostly brown but some reddish ones too.  My dog has never thrown up due to this food unlike some of the reviewers here. I have noticed that there is a lot of grease, so much that the Amazon box has absorbed some of it.  In summary I am a little concerned that I do not know if what is in the bag is what is advertised on the bag.",

I have been using this food for several months and all five fur kids are losing a significant amount of fur, developed dry/irritated skin, have low energy, have terrible breath, and are having frequent episodes of vomiting and/or eating grass due to upset stomach. I\u0027ve also noticed my dogs have been drinking a tremendous amount of water since switching to this brand. More concerning, my boxer/mastiff passed out this morning and I believe there may be a correlation with this food.  I  gave her some healthy protein and she immediately perked back up and is back to herself.  I will not be purchasing any more of this product and will be transitioning my dogs to a different brand immediately.",

It smells so fresh and we don\u2019t even need to add the wet food for her to enjoy it. Even the 5 year old boxer seems to enjoy it more, although he will eat anything.

As a matter of fact, I switched to it after one of my dogs started to have acid reflux after eating a different brand, and it helped.  However, this most recent bag I bought in May has made both of my dogs sick.  My first dog started to gag/vomit after eating and then started to avoid the food, then a few days later,  my second dog started to vomit after eating, too. I thought maybe they were sharing a dog stomach virus, I fed them both a bland diet of chicken and rice until their stomachs were better then after one day back on this food it started all over again, that is when I realized it was definitely the food.  I started them back on the bland diet and switched food and now they are fine.  I was warned about buying dog food from Amazon as it can be a knock-off, and I wish I had listened to the warning.  Buy the food from a reputable food store!",

Got tired of it, not buying from this seller ever again.As for this product having Trace Amounts an pesticide. Name me one product of a national food chain that sells 0% anything remotely pesticide free, you can\u0027t. Food you and I eat, salads, grain foods and so on all have it; or some base chemical.This is good stuff. Smells good enough to eat, LOL. Rachel Ray has been popping this stuff in her mouth since it\u0027s conception. I like the simple and nutritious contents. The dogs stools are easy to break down with a hose in the yard. Almost completely washes away. Grass is not any worse for it either, actually greener spots where we wash it down. Urine is not super yellow either like some dog foods can cause. Still smells like dog crap, but not acid or overly foul. Dog owners, you know what I am talking about. The stools are also less hard, so easier passing of waste unlike a store brand or two I can think of, hey Roy Ol boy.",

She ate it just fine and never had bouts of diarrhea or throwing up, but she developed terrible skin issues and I was needing to bathe her CONSTANTLY because she always stank! I was washing bedding, furniture and carpets regularly and my house only continued smelling worse. After I noticed the huge flakes of skin on her back and raised red patches I decided to make some food for her myself and- lo an behold- she is doing a million times better. Once a week I put together rice, vegetables and turkey (I found my recipe online) and I supplement with chewable vitamins. She looks and smells like a million bucks, and I\u2019m not breaking the bank! Thanks Rachael Ray for pushing me to make my dog healthier; I\u2019m pretty convinced that this food is garbage.",

But the vet said its not good to have an all protein meat diet.  Her digestion is better, her skin too, so now she has a more balanced diet.",
