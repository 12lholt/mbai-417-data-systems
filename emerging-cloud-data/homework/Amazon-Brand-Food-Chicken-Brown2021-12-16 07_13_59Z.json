My dog didn\u2019t seem to mind the switch at all, and she has not shown adverse reactions\u2014with the exception that she seems to get slight tear burns.  Nothing major, and the ingredients seem similar to Merrick\u2019s, but there must be a minor difference.  Still, it is a viable alternative.",

None are picky but I try \u0026 feed the 14 yr old (beagle/chihuahua) a small breed better quality food. Bought the Wag, beef type the first time. It was enjoyed by all. The next round I got chicken Wag.  I didn\u0027t really blame the food on the sickness, my old Spaniel got listless, then she was hardly getting around, then had a stroke \u0026 then put to sleep! This was a 2 week time span. The Chigle was throwing up every day... (And he is a napkin eater with a goats constitution) and he isn\u0027t wanting to eat it... So I let big Betty have some, \u0026 after a couple days she won\u0027t eat it. (Remarkable bc she eats road kill if no body is watching). So I have an entire 30# bag that will become fertilizer. Im sorry I didn\u0027t investigate the food further, I just never thought to blame it... Until Betty wouldn\u0027t eat it. The Spaniel we put to sleep was her mother, 14 years old. Betty is 12, and they had never been apart, so her listlessness I chalked up to depression. \uD83D\uDE2B No more Wag for us, before I run out of waggers!",

We typically go through a 40 lb bag in less than a month, so we felt this was worth a try.  I compared the ingredients to our previous brand and found they were the same.  Wag actually has fewer ingredients, which I feel makes it superior, because the first named ingredients are the same as the high quality brand.  Since we do supplements for bone health, the added ingredients in the name brand are superfluous.

Usually my dog eats great quality food. She normally poops 1-2 times a day and the stools are small and firm. Smaller and firmer stool= your pet is absorbing and digesting most of the nutrients of the food they are ingesting. After feeding her this garbage food(same portions as previous quality food) she was defecating 2-3 times a day and they were huuuge stools. Thus, this food has too many fillers and little nutrients. For the sake of you pup. For them to be happier, healthier, live a long life, just spend a few more bucks to get better quality food than this garbage. This is literally by far the worst quality food I\u2019ve ever seen, except for maybe Alpo. Amazon should not be creating budget friendly dog food and should  be ashamed.",

    "body": "Good Quality Dry Dog Food. My rather picky, 4yo female American Pit Bull Terrier loves it! Before this she was on some Rachel Ray Grain Free dry dog food. I got my dog when she was about 9 months old and all she had ever eaten up to that point was grain free dry dog food. Over the years I have given her grain free and  have also tried dry dog food with grain. For whatever reason she did not like the last Rachel Ray Grain Free Dog food, so when I found that she LOVES this Wag Dry Dog Food I threw away ~1/2 a big bag of the Rachel Ray Grain Free Dog food, I think I am going to go ahead and stop giving her grain free dog food. After all she is my third dog in 25 years and the 2 previous dogs never ate Grain Free Dog Food and both of them were purebred A.P.B.T.s and both lived long healthy lives to around ~15-16 years. So yeah, no more grain free for Stella. So far she loves this WAG dry dog food, so if she completes this bag then I am sure I will buy some more when it goes on sale again.",

The dogs loved the beef flavor so I thought I would quick buy a couple more bags of the beef while it was still on sale, well beef was out of stock but salmon was in shock so I bought two more of those.  I thought if the beef is good, the salmon should be good too.  When I finished the beef I switched to the salmon.  My dogs will not eat it!  They hate It!  I have fed them other quality salmon brands with no issues, they won\u0027t touch this stuff and I am stuck with 3 bags of the salmon flavor. The sale is over and at a 1.20 per pound, the Wag brand is not worth it in my opinion.  Switched back to  Purina and the 40\u002B pound bags. I doubt Amazon will take back my unopened bags so I will donate them to the local pound.  I have 2 labs so I like the bigger bags.  They are not picky eaters but they sure hated the salmon flaver!",

We have 2 dogs at the moment but only 1 is actually ours. The other is here because a family member is here. They both love this food! I try and only feed them food where real meat is the 1st ingredient and both dogs eat this food with no fuss! A bonus is that I can have it shipped to me automatically and the shipping is free. With a different online retailer, I can have it automatically shipped to me but there\u2019s a minimum order amount or I have to pay shipping and I usually only need the food so it just makes more sense for me to buy from Amazon.",

He gets lots of ear infections and other stuff leading to our vet to believe he\u0027s allergic to Beef, Chicken, and Lamb. Fortunately, this salmon dog food brand does not give him ear allergies to date. I have personally ordered many bags ahead of time since my dog seems to overall enjoy it.Yet, I have seen what others have experienced with this brand. My dog sometimes throws up after eating this food a few hours later but usually it is a yellow bile. Reading online I found out that this means my dog\u0027s stomach is empty so for whatever reason his body must process this food at a much more rapid pace than other previously used brands. We have resolved this issue by simply splitting his meals across the day so his stomach is at ease.Overall, I found my dog was not allergic to food. Yet, I\u0027m still kind of skeptical that he\u0027s \u0022processing\u0022 the food much quicker than other brands. Not sure if this is because it has less fillers and/or it\u0027s less \u0022pure\u0022.Note: We previously bought Pedigree Steak and Chicken (prior to his allergies) then shifted him to Kirkland Signature Lamb dog food",

The Wag ingredients are similar with somewhat more protein. Worth a try.  He likes it better.  He often would fail to finish his Blue. He licks the bowl with Wag.  Your dog may have different preferences.  But at roughly 35 percent of the Blue price it\u0027s worth buying to find out.",

The size of the kibble is small so great for tiny puppy teeth and mouths. I started my dogs off by adding a little to their previous brand of kibble and every few days, just increase the amount of WAG kibble, until their food was all WAG. So far, based on my experience, I do recommend giving this kibble a try. As another reviewer has stated, it is very similar to the Taste of the Wild High Prairie puppy kibble but not as expensive.",

Given as she is a diva about most dog food, I wasn\u0027t overly surprised and usually try to add a topper or something else mixed in to encourage her to eat it, but even that didn\u0027t entice her with this particular dog food. I like the idea behind this stuff, but now after reading others\u0027 reviews on it recently and repeatedly trying to get her to eat it with no success whatsoever, I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s something wrong with it if she is refusing to go near it like this. She just barks at me and gets ticked off until I throw the whole bowl out in the trash and start over to give her something else - anything else, really.

    "body": "Terrible! Made both dogs ill. We subscribed to this food a while back. At first, the food was quality and you could tell that it was similar to other more expensive brands. However, we have witnessed the decline in quality over the months. So much so that the kibble pieces turn in to a dust almost, which you can see in other posts. The last batch we opened and when we gave it to our dogs they sniffed it but wouldn\u2019t eat it. I thought it odd but I decided they weren\u2019t hungry at the time or stressed out because we just moved. They ended up eating it and almost immediately became ill. Like, violently ill. Vomiting and diarrhea all over our new place. We had just moved and they were stressed, so I thought it might be that and didn\u2019t account for the food because it was the same food we had been giving them for months. To make a 3\u002B week  story short, we had to take them to the vet and after all types of expensive testing, back and forth visits, they determined it had to be because of the food. After reading the other reviews about other dogs becoming ill, I can agree. We changed their food to the doggie brat diet (pumpkin, rice and chicken) and we are now slowly introducing another brand of kibble. They are now much better, but I\u2019d use my expensive and stressful experience and buy another brand. I have also contacted customer service so that other dogs do not become ill like ours.",

We also like that it has grains as we are trying to avoid grain free dog foods since they are associated with DCM, a canine heart disease known as taurine-deficient dilated cardiomyopathy.  Taurine has also been added, as well as Glucosamine, but not chondroitin.  The ingredient list is impressive, there is no by product meal, corn, soy or wheat.  The kibble barely smells, and the size is good for medium to large breed, not really for toy or tiny breeds. Packaged in a not so fancy bag and with no zip lock feature on the small bag:( The chicken is priced even more reasonable.  I think this food is a great deal, with great ingredients at a great price. Maverick the retriever had no stomach issues and likes the food, we will consider purchasing again.  Its made in the USA and its rate 4.5 out of 5 stars on DogFoodAdvisor.  Again, I am recommending the Wag Wholesome Grain dog food, not the grain free!",

I ordered this product because I own two breeds that are susceptible to diet induced skin allergies (Rottweiler and lab).  I read how it was difficult on the gut for them to transition.  Lots of dogs experienced diarrhea and vomiting if the owners rushed the transition in diet.  I signed up anyhow as the price was right for an ultra-healthy dog food.  Turns out not only did it give them gas and the runs and the occasional vomiting, but it also smells very unpleasant right out of the bag and it\u0027s all I could do to coax them into eating it.  After my subscribe and save orders were stacking up and they still weren\u0027t thrill to eat.  I eventually cancelled all further deliveries and changed brands.  Results are better now but I\u0027m stuck with about 45 pounds of the old brand.  I plan on donating it to my local vet in case he is aware of anyone with a dog that is so desperately prone to allergies that they may wish to try this product.

Which is very hard not to find in most dog food nowadays. Though, even though he\u2019s currently on Purina One\u2019s True Instinct, it\u2019s always good to look for cheaper alternatives. So, why not try this?This of course has no corn, no by product meal, no wheat or soy. Includes whole grains, promotes healthy digestion, immunity, and has probiotics and fiber. While real American beef is the first ingredient.What I like about it immediately is the size of the kibble isn\u2019t too large. Even though I have a large dog, he still eats too fast to process big food well. So smaller pieces does him quite well. They are merely tiny discs so that makes it super easy forhim to chew and not choke. There was also was no change in his feces unlike other brands that make his stool loose as well.Another thing I like is it doesn\u2019t have any weird smell to it. The smell of the dog food is very mild if not unnoticeable. So, you can\u2019t really smell any fillers in there.This dog food is also very rich in essential vitamins. Like Zinc, Crude Fat, Crude Protein, Vitamin E, and a few others for overall digestive and overall health. So, it definitely provides enough energy for the average dog.But, there are some thing that I don\u2019t like about this brand already. They don\u2019t have nearly enough B vitamins as well as vitamin A, C, and E for my dogs diet. He requires a lot of B vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids because of his skin conditions. So, this has little to none which really doesn\u2019t help his skin or coat.Secondly, the price just doesn\u2019t do it for me. I paid nearly $43 for my dogs food for a 40lb bag. This is $38 and it doesn\u2019t include nearly enough protein or the vitamins he needs to repair his ailments. Not to mention, 10lbs of dogs food definitely makes a difference when I only have to buy him ONE BAG Per MONTH.  He would need another two bags to make up the difference of his other food.I\u2019m glad my dog likes the taste of this food and I didn\u2019t see anything strange in it as well. BUT, I can\u2019t see myself switching to a brand like this because of my dog breeds limitations. Though, this would be perfect for dogs that just require smaller amounts of everyday nutrition. Otherwise, not the best choice for me.PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.Thanks for reading:)",

We have never had a dog - from doxies, to newfies to hounds - get sick and all of our guests seem to enjoy what was put in front of them.I like that WAG is grain inclusive and they source their ingredients from the United States. I feel comfortable telling their parents that I fed them an extra meal and it was WAG.I also  like that WAG is affordable. A 30 pound bag is $38.

The ingredients in this dog food appear to be very good quality, American beef is the number one ingredient and the food is made in the USA.My dogs eat this food with no hesitation, they gobble it down. My dogs have not experienced any digestive upset or any ill effects from this dog food, they are as happy and healthy as ever. The price is very fair for this dog food.

She ate an entire box of chocolate that was under the Christmas tree and never got sick. But she\u2019ll throw up this food, have diarrhea, and when I feed her, she just looks at it and walks away. Trust me when I say she is not a picky eater, I\u2019ve had her since she was 8 weeks old. She never throws up or has issues going to do her business. We\u2019ve tried numerous brands of dog food and she happily ate every one. This is the only one she doesn\u2019t want to eat and the only one that has caused her problems. She can\u2019t digest it well and doesn\u2019t like the smell/taste of it. I read the ingredients and they seem legit, but something is off with this product. I was debating throwing it all out or buying another bag of food and trying to incorporate this into it. I obviously don\u2019t want to waste it or waste the money, but as I write this review after just feeding her, she just looked at it, huffed, walked away and laid next to me. We gave it a shot for about a week, but it\u2019s going in the trash.",

I\u0027m also not going to assume that my experience, and that of my dogs, is a universal one. I\u0027m just going to give an honest review.I am currently feeding this food to two of my dogs. One is a chipin and the other is a hound mix. They both transitioned well to this food. They have had no Gi tract issues or vomiting. They are not gassy. BMs are very regular, They both seem to like the taste. They are healthy. The chipin is under 8 pounds, and she does okay with the size, but I think she would prefer it if the pieces were smaller. This is not my first choice of food for my dogs, but I see this food as a solid option that is also budget-friendly.  I would buy it again.",

It may be toxic to blood, kidneys, liver, skin, central nervous system of your pet.\u0022 After reading through other reviews it appears some peoples dogs have got ill, now that obviously could be a sensitivity but it also could be from this ingredient. . .

First of all let me start by saying that My dog is a fussy eater (which surprises me since he came from a shelter and basically they fed their dogs what ever was donated to them. Which was all different brands.)So I have been trying to get him to eat and spending a lot of money on brand name kibble. If he eats it it will only be for a couple of feedings and then he would turn up his nose to it and refuse to eat it.That is until a friend recommended the Amazon Wag dog food to me.He seems to really like it so far. If this changes I may come back and update this review.So if you have a fussy eater give the Wag dog food a try. I believe they sell smaller bags.",

    "body": "2 SICK DOGS I don\u0027t know if this was just a bad batch or not, but after reading other reviews from December 2020 onwards, I\u0027m starting to think this is just a bad brand. We have been buying this for the 8-12 months for our dogs and NEVER had a problem with it. However, with the bag we purchased a few weeks ago, they have been sick/throwing up for the past few days and been VERY low-energy/just want to be alone. Both our dogs are usually high-energy (2.5 year old queens-land heeler and a corgi) and LOVE to cuddle. While I don\u0027t want to definitively say that people should not buy this brand, I will not be since this is literally the only thing that could cause my dogs to be sick and acting this way (we don\u0027t have any chemicals in the house, only use pet-friendly cleaners that get put away after every use, don\u0027t let them out unmonitored so they can\u0027t eat/get into anything bad outside, bring their own water and bowl to the park so they don\u0027t share with other dogs...).",

I did not notice at first  because I slowed phased it in with her other food so no problem right away. Then, I started noticing my dog spitting up and eating grass. It took a bit of trial and error but finally figured it was the food. My dog is a 12 y o mutt so maybe she\u2019s becoming more sensitive.On this review, I gave a 3 star for flavor but honestly who knows? I did not eat it and my dog\u2019s not talking but she didn\u2019t refuse it. Heck she had never refused food so that not exactly a stellar recommendation.Since I no longer have the huge shipping box, I can\u2019t send it back. Bummer",

We\u2019re not just talking a little vomiting... repetitive vomiting.So we discontinued use disappointed and worried that it could have long term effects. For a week after our dogs had swollen lymph glands and still weren\u2019t acting 100% normal.Yesterday morning I was half asleep and dumped food out of our food container with spout and went on my way. That\u2019s when the vomiting started again. I had forgotten that we had a new replacement food that was in a bag and not switched out yet.I was so disappointed in myself for forgetting, but even more disappointed in the company that could make a food like this and that AMAZON claims this brand.We had tried the WAG chicken jerkey about a year or so ago and my dogs literally wouldn\u2019t eat it so it went in the garbage.If you are sitting there thinking \u201CWhat\u2019s one bad review when this food is so cheap and well marketed?\u201DThink again.We are thankful to still have our pups not to mention thousands of dollars in vet bills we could have accrued if we had continued feeing them this dreadful food.",

I was psyched since it had quality ingredients \u0026 it was a heckuvalot cheaper than anything else, so I ordered sample bags of 2 flavors to try. They all usually gobble up their food at meal times, however no matter what I mixed either of the Wag with, they wouldn\u2019t touch it. I even tried mixing it with another dry food and apparently they could tell because at first they walked away from it until they reluctantly ate it finally when they figured out that was all or nothing. Since they contribute nada to their food budget, I considered that even if I substituted it for every other 30-40lb bag \u0026 mixed it with another kibble I would still save $$. But reading all of the other reviews seemed like dogs either loved it, hated it, and/or it made them sick, I decided it just wasn\u2019t worth continuing to buy it just to save money \u0026 chance the possibility it could  eventually make them sick. Or worse. Especially since they just did not like it. So they win and I\u2019ll just work more overtime...The things we do for our fur babies...!",

    "body": "Quality food, reasonably priced and my smaller dogs love it. First off I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not enough of an expert to rate the quality of the ingredients in this food. However I always research any dog food before I switch to see what actual experts say and make sure I\u2019m not feeding my dogs something unhealthy or potentially harmful. I was satisfied with what I was able to find out about Wag so I gave it a try.What I can say is my three small dogs love this food. I have two Brussels Griffons and a pug who can be a picky eater and it\u2019s not often I find something suitable for all three. I was a little concerned the pieces might be too big for the Brussels Griffons but they don\u2019t seem to have any problem with it and my pug ate it without hesitation the very first time I gave it to them.If you have smaller dogs you know it can be a challenge finding the appropriate size food in bulk at a reasonable price. Food for toy breeds would be ideal but it\u2019s typically sold in smaller sized bags at a premium cost. I love my dogs but there\u2019s a limit to how much I can spend to feed them.So far so good with Wag. They\u2019ve gone thru two 30 lb. bags of the \u201Cchicken and brown rice\u201D recipe with no issues and I recently switched to \u201Cbeef and lentil with wild boar\u201D and they seem to love it just as much.Hopefully you\u2019ll have great results as well and if you catch it on sale it\u2019s definitely worth a try.",

    "body": "Makes my dogs sick to their stomachs Around Christmas time the food I normally feed my dogs was back ordered and as the ingredients on this food looked okay, I decided to try it for my two dogs. One of my dogs will eat anything, so she still scarfed her food right up but my other dog didn\u2019t like this food at all and it was a struggle to get him to eat it. Despite tapering off their old food and introducing increasing quantities of this food over the course of a week and a half, both my dogs had extreme gastric distress and things smelled very unpleasant at our house for a few weeks. Thankfully we were able to purchase their regular food again but due to the upset to their systems caused by this food, they experienced a couple more weeks of stomach issues while transitioning back to their old food. I\u2019ve changed their food various times over the years and I\u2019ve never had it happen that stomach upset continues for a couple weeks even after discontinuing a food. If it were just one of my dogs I would assume they had an intolerance to an ingredient in the food, but since it really messed up both of my dogs\u2019 stomachs I really wonder if this food could possibly be all that great. I also didn\u2019t like how it\u2019s all uniform little round kibble pieces. It could be that I\u2019m used to different shapes and sizes as well as a salmon odor from their normal food, but this stuff doesn\u2019t appear or smell like it would be any fun for a dog to eat. Based on my experience I can\u2019t recommend this product but all dogs are different and maybe it will work for your dog.",

I placed three separate orders for the Amazon Brand, and feel like the price is reasonable. However the the problems I have with it are that the packaging is not recyclable (not animal friendly). The other major problem I have with this food is that my food motivated dogs really struggle to eat it every time. They are the type to lick the bowl clean, but this Amazon Brand food they just do not like and I have noticed they always leave it behind. Because of that I gave the food a 3/5 rating due to flavor not appetizing to my regularly food driven dogs.",

As soon as this was delivered and I opened it he was circling it dying to get a taste! I bought the Salmon.My dog is 9yrs old and 65lbs. The food has been excellent. I like the shape and size, as it slows down his eating a bit. I don\u0027t like the weird red fake coloring in many dog foods, and thankfully, this doesn\u0027t have that. The ingredients look pretty solid, which is important to me as I want my dog to live a long time. :) The price for the quality is very good! I\u0027m sure we will be coming back for more soon.

The ingredients are decent, and all 3 of my dogs, aged from 4 years old to 14 years old, like it and are doing well on it.  I mix it with a good quality canned food, and I also give them some cooked chicken and supplements for joints and skin/coat health.  The ingredients for the price were the selling point for me.  I would be more comfortable, however, knowing I could call somebody to ask questions or report a problem, however, so I don\u0027t think this will be a permanent choice for me.",

My dog (fairly active 9-year-old GSP) wasn\u0027t enthusiastic about it, but nor did he shun it. The ingredients are okay, but pretty heavy on the grains (5 of the first 7 ingredients are grains; and while the first ingredient is salmon, but that includes tons of water weight, so much less by volume once the water is removed).But there was nothing objectionable on the list, and it seemed to have good vitamins, minerals \u0026 probiotics.

Neither dog takes more than a day to get digestively used to the dog food, and a 30 lb bag usually lasts about 35 days.For the first two weeks, my iron stomached husky had very loose, light colored wet poop, and my shiba had the same along with a yellowish vomit that smelled like the food.  The second two weeks have been better (i.e. occasional vomit, and light colored poop when eating only the food); however their food consumption is down by 30-40%, and I\u0027ve had to add eggs, meat, and veggies to the food to encourage them to eat.It might be a bad batch, or just an ingredient doesn\u0027t agree with them, but I will not be returning to Wag.",

Plus I guess it was my fault but rice is the third ingredient that\u2019s pretty high on the list for a filler. I think too much filler not enough good food for my pups. Last thing I started to notice is my pups would start skipping meals and wouldn\u2019t only eat it if they had to type of thing so immediately changed them back to their normal quality brand. I guess it\u2019s true you get what you pay for. Don\u2019t let the \u201Cgood\u201D reviews food you. I feel in the long run this food is no good for our furry little friends.

When it comes to dry dog food, it\u0027s no different, the foods must - first and foremost, taste great, or the finicky him wouldn\u0027t even eat, second, it must be in smaller bits or he\u0027d leave it. BUT, if it\u0027s both great tasting \u0026 small bits, thx entire bowl will disappear in merely 2-3 minutes.This is exactly what happened when I fed him for the very first few times this brand new dry dog food from Amazon called WAG, and it\u0027s got some of the best healthy ingredients that I want him to have, Salmon (Omega-3 fatty acids), brown rice, no fillers such as chicken byproducts, corn, soy etc, no preservatives, only best quality ingredients. In addition, it\u0027s got Probiotic and fiber Support for health digestion, no more throwing up what he\u0027s chewed.But the best sign is that he\u0027s enjoying eating healthy \u0026 the happiness this WAG dry bits bring him on a daily basis, there\u0027s nothing that makes me, the pet owner, more satisfying than I\u0027m feeding him healthy foods that he actually enjoying eating \u0026 is good for him. Finally, unlike other national more well-known pet food brands that can be very expensive, mostly due to expensive advertising cost. WAG, Amazon\u0027s own brand, it\u0027s something I KNOW I can always trust without having to shell out premium dollars for PREMIUM dry dog foods that are good for my beloved golden retriever Bailey!\uD83D\uDC95\uD83D\uDC9E\uD83D\uDC9E\uD83D\uDC4DHIGHLY RECOMMENDED\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC95\uD83D\uDC95\uD83D\uDC9E",

I have a large boxer/german shepherd mix dog and in her older age she has become very picky with the food she eats. We decided to try this dog food for her and she likes it! She normally likes to have a topper or some wet food mixed in with her dry food and this one is the same way. She doesn\u0027t like it enough to just eat it plain. The first few ingredients are chicken, chicken meal, whole grain brown rice, barley and white rice. I like seeing these ingredients listed first but the ingredients list here is very long.

    "body": "Has grains and probiotics/ Reasonable price I think this is a solid choice for dog food. The price is very reasonable. The food is made in California. The chicken is sourced from within the USA. The first few ingredients on the label are chicken, chicken meal and brown rice. It doesn\u2019t have any preservatives, flavors or other junk ingredients. The kibble is medium-sized.The nutritional analysis is pretty similar to other good quality dog foods that we\u2019ve tried; protein 24% min., fat 14% min, fiber 3% max., moisture 10% max. The food has grain which is a great change. There was a lot of hype around grain-free for a while. From what I know that\u2019s been debunked. Plus, my vet was telling me that I should feed my dog food with grains so it was a no brainer for me.  I\u2019m also seeing vitamins, minerals and probiotics on the label. I\u2019ve noticed that probiotics really make a difference on my Lab Retriever\u2019s health, specifically, she throws up less and her stools look healthy. I\u2019m happy to see that there are many different strains of probiotic in the food.I followed the directions on the bag to gradually introduce my dog to the new food. The first couple nights that we started feeding her this food (with her old food) she threw up. I think it was because of the size of the kibble and that she eats too fast. I ended up splashing some warm water on the kibble and just the act of licking the sides of her bowl is helping her to slow her eating.Overall, I think this is a really GOOD CHOICE for dog food. It\u2019s good quality and you\u2019re NOT paying an arm and a leg for it.",

My dog weighs about 60lbs and these were a good size for him.My dog always requires some form of a topper on kibble as he is picky (this kibble is no different - no kibble is the exception). Once the topper was on he had no problem with him eating it! He enjoyed these as he did his previous brand and I thought this was a good value-purchase for dog food. The ingredient list is longer than some brands, but the primary protein is the first ingredient listed (Salmon).This isn\u0027t the highest quality of dog food you can get, but for the balance between money/ quality is good! Overall, I have been impressed by all Wag products.  We also tried the Beef variation and a bunch of the dog treats and he liked it just as much!",

I even put it in a human bowl thinking I could trick him into believing it was people food. Otis Jackson was not at all fooled. That being said, I still gave it four stars because 1) Otis is an unusually picky eater, and basically hates all kibble other than Kibble and Bits (and even that he doesn\u0027t really like all that much, but at least he eats it begrudgingly), and 2) this stuff smells significantly better than other dog food, which combined with the wholesome ingredient list makes me think it is quality/ well made.  It comes in small enough bags where you can try it and see what your dog thinks.  I might try mixing it with his usual kibble to see if I can get him to give it a chance, will update this review next week and let you know how that goes.",

    "body": "Dogs Love It This is a terrific dog food. The ingredients are clean. Salmon is the first on the list. The kibble i s the perfect size for dogs, small, medium and large to handle. It is low odor. My dogs eat it enthusiastically. I\u0027ve observed no negative reactions to consumption. It seems soothing to those with sensitive stomachs. Perfect for pets and the people who love them.",

    "body": "Very small nuggets I have a couple of senior dogs who get easily bored eating the same foods day after day, so I supplement with different kibble varieties to keep their appetites up. They liked this food a lot (their usual kibble is not fish-based like this), they ate all of these pellets even though they left some of their regular pellets.One star off for the very tiny nugget size: probably suitable for little dogs, but my larger ones inhale these without even chewing. On the other hand, this is a good nugget size for filling \u201Cpuzzle ball\u201D feeders.",

    "body": "Great flavor We introduced this to our dog as per the suggestion from Wag and mixed it in with her old food gradually. She likes this flavor.I did not give it a full 5 stars because I think there needs to be a way to reseal the package, especially with the way the bag is designed - cutting it open is awkward, and this seems to be an issue with most dog food companies.",

And they ate it until it was gone. They will do the same with this bag. They always find the salmon flavor extra good.",
